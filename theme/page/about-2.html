              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p class="lead">Dear friend, glad you find me here. My name is Joyce (Yanru) Jiang. I have been living in Los Angeles for five years and I fall in love with every thing in this dynamic city. </p>
              <p>I studied at University of Southern California for both my undergraduate and graduate studies. I majored in Business Administration & Cinematic Arts for my bachelor’s degree and communication management for my master’s degree. In my last year at USC, I push myself to learn data analytics at a boot camp program from our engineering school. At first, I was just curious to know the mindset of technical people and to have a taste of how data-driven expert would view the world. Luckily, with this experience, I have been able to explore different computational skills, such as <strong>Python, SQL, R, MATLAB, MongoDB</strong>, etc. Right now, I am taking my gap year to spend time on conducting both communication and finance research and several data analytic projects. </p>

              </div>

              <p>For my finance research, I used different-in-different method in econometrical modeling to analyze how corporate leverage ratios would change after merger and acquisition activities in China. I categorized public companies based on their natures, industries, and regions to compare their differences in both short-term and long-time changes. <strong>STATA</strong> is the handful tool I selected for this labor-intensive research because of its high capacity in constructing and processing regression models.</p>
              <p>I conducted two research projects in communication science during my master’s study. One was about the fandom psychology of Pop Idol Group culture in East Asia. Though there is definitely theoretical grounding in this paper (self-identity construction and social capital acquisition theories), I selected this topic particularly based both my roommate Joan’s and my fascination in K-pop cultures. Indeed, we lived in Koreantown at that time, and could not stop from eating Korean food as our daily meals (our favorite one is budae-jjigae because we can add anything eatable ingredients to the pot). Luckily, the proposal of this research was selected by Western Psychology Association 99th conference at Pasadena, CA for poster presentation. Even more luckily, this paper has been accepted by AEJMC Conference 2020, Entertainment Studies Division this year for another poster presentation.</p>

              </div>


              <p>The second paper was about game addition of casual mobile games (like Candy Crash). Though I was more confident in this research because I used a complicated method this time, it was rejected by AEJMC this year. I personally do not have any experience in game addition, but I’m always curious about media psychology at that time. </p>
              <p>In the summer of COVID19, I was thinking about using my time more wisely in improving my data analytic skills and exploring more analytic methods through different tools. I reached out to the founder of Whitehead Communication on Twitter, and we are now working together on developing methodology for data collection and analysis, with the emphasis on COVID19 in Uganda. I used Geiph for network analysis and Python for scraping, visualization, text analysis and sentiment analysis a lot during this time. Right now, I’m pretty much struggling with improving the accuracy of unsupervised NLP models (supervised models are too labor intensive for our team) for Uganda COVID19-related content.</P>
              <p>I appreciate your patience for reading the entire page and sorry that I “ramble” a lot here. This is a short introduction about me. Hope you can find more interesting and useful content on this website. Take care and stay healthy. </p>
              <br>  </br>
              <p>Your best friend,</p>
              <p>Joyce Jiang</p>
