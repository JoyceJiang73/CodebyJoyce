      <p>Declare: My code is adapted from holwech's personal blog "Automatic news scraping with Python, Newspaper and Feedparser", you can check it out at <a href="https://holwech.github.io/blog/Automatic-news-scraper/">https://holwech.github.io/blog/Automatic-news-scraper/</a>. The author also provided a Github download, you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/holwech/NewsScraper">https://github.com/holwech/NewsScraper</a>. This automatic scraping tool uses Newspaper library to scraping multiple news websites at the same time. You can find the documentation of Newspaper library at <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper">https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper</a>.</p>
      <p>Thanks holwech for sharing a Python code. I modified this script by adding other elements, such as keywords, summary, and authors to collect from news articles with the help of Newspaper's documentation. I also developed a method to tranfer newspaper's JSON export file to a dataframe. This script is published for study and research exploration purpose only, and it would not be used for any commercial purpose.</p>
      <p>I used an example of Ugandan Newspaper Json file to test hotwech's method. I will also share this file in my Github Repo.</p>

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By BigEyeUg Team\n\nKampala City socialite, fashionista, and brand influencer Sheila Gashumba is fond of exhibiting her ego without giving a damn about what anyone else on the other side feels.\n\nThe pencil-sized fashion lover who has been in disarray with different media houses for the past two months over her controversial Shs.50K paycheck revelation is up in arms with Radio Sanyu’s FatBoy.\n\nThis is after she played a tit-for-tat with former 88.2 Sanyu FM presenter James Onen (FatBoy), who was fired from the station earlier this week.\n\nTaking it to her social handles, Sheila blew a strong horn of triumph for FatBoy’s sacking as she asked him to recall when she stood up for those who were being used in the media with little pay and he made fun of it.\n\nSheila says it’s unbelievable that FatBoy chose to strike over a 25% salary cut because of COVID-19 despite siding with the bosses’ repeated unfair actions towards their employees over the years.\n\n“Says FatBoy on 2nd May 2020 but decided to strike because of a 25% salary cut because of COVID-19 yet he was earning an 8figure amount!!! Lemme even stop here, Tomorrow I’m waking up to listen to Patrick Salvado Idringi on 88.2 Sanyu FM,” wrote Sheila.\n\nSheila Gashumba and FatBoy\n\nIn FatBoy’s statement dated 2nd May 2020 that has been resurrected by Sheila, he condemned her reasoning over the media houses’ alleged Shs. 50K paycheck and advised her to focus on building her brand before she would task bosses for a pay increase.\n\n“So, if a TV station offers you 50K for your first gig, take the money and build your brand. Eventually they will have t increase your money or better opportunities will come your way.”\n\n“Sheila Gashumba is promoting a dangerous entitlement mentality that has afflicted a lot of millennials, unfortunately. Which partly explains why most of them are unemployed today,” wrote the Sanyu FM presenter by then.\n\nRead FatBoy’s Submission to Sheila Gashumba’s 50K Saga in full:\n\nI think the important salient point missed in the all this is that for a lot of people their first gig, whether on TV or anywhere, its important stepping stone to bigger opportunities down the road. Its dangerous to give young people the impression that they deserve millions from the start of their careers because mbu thet “deserve more”. If they have that mentality, they will never even get one foot in the door. Many successful people started by earning absolutely nothing. Then you build a name over time and take it from there. So if a TV station offers you 50K for your first gig, take the money and build your brand. Eventually they will have t increase your money or better opportunities will come your way. Sheila Gashumba is promoting a dangerous entitlement mentality that has afflicted a lot of millennials, unfortunately. Which partly explains why most of them are unemployed today.\n\nOnen is among Sanyu FM’s staff members who were sent-off by the management after they staged a sit-down strike over a 25% pay cut.\n\nWe will keep you posted.&#39;,

The music legend, who recently gave birth to a bouncing baby boy was spotted taking a stroll on the street with her son in a stroller.

Desperate being abroad, friends still managed to send her gifts all the way from Uganda.\n\nThe new mother kept her whole pregnancy a secret from the media until the day of delivery and she broke the news herself with a photo of her holding her baby on a hospital bed which went viral minutes after she had posted it. This was quite a stunt that many couldn’t have managed to pull off.\n\nCongrats again Juliana.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Find out information about Coronavirus in Uganda. More here.\n\nBy Our Reporter\n\n“When Universities closed in March, I thought it would be for a short time so I decided to take a break from studies and relax a bit,” says Doreen Namuli, a second year student of Economics at Makerere University. “But when the first three weeks ended, I started feeling rusty and I knew I had to read in order not to lose grips on what I had learnt and hopefully, use this time to read ahead.”\n\nIt goes without saying that most university courses are research based and average students typically spend more time in the library as than in the lecture rooms. Therefore, reading notes and handouts alone did not make much sense to Namuli as she needed to refer to the referenced material which she did not have.\n\n“Back at campus, I would easily download this material from the library or anywhere around the University with WiFi,” says Namuli “So I asked my parents to buy me data bundles.”\n\nAlthough the bundles were availed, Namuli knows that they were costly especially at such a time when her mother’s business remains closed due to the COVID-19 prevention guidelines.\n\nLike Namuli, Lynn Kwikiriza, a third year Law student at Uganda Christian University admitted to the biting cost of data while studying at home; “I was used to opting for the library Wi-Fi while at campus. Mobile data while at home is quite costly given these hard times.”\n\nIn different phone interviews with some university students, they all expresses the high cost of accessing learning material online. However, MTN closed that gap by zero rating university elearning sites, just like it did for the Primary and secondary school learners.\n\nStudents from universities including Makerere, Uganda Christian University, Uganda Martyrs, Kyambogo, International University of East Africa, Mbarara and Gulu are benefitting from this offer. By zero rating the elearning platforms, lecturers can upload study materials to the platforms at no data cost to enable students study for free while at home.\n\n“Oh my God, It’s the best offer ever. You know how we lawyers read widely and heavily. I am sorted,” Kwikiriza said hysterically. “It’s amazing and very convenient. I can see their results and course work marks at any time without data worries.”\n\nThis offer has seen many learners get out of their comfort zones and study despite the pandemic and lockdown.\n\nAccording to Trevor Ochom, a final year student of Education at Kyambogo University this offer is an answered prayer.\n\n“When it’s all said and done, I know we shall have quite a marathon back at university once schools re open. So the best way to keep up is by reading ahead while at home,” says Ochom, noting that this offer makes studying while at home very easy. “You don’t even need a laptop, a simple smart phone is enough. I appeal to fellow students to use their time at home productively.”\n\nAccording to Kwikiriza, the content on the website is insightful and students have no excuse whatsoever when it comes to studying: ”I would totally recommend it to my course mates and friends seeing as we need all the information we can get at the moment.”\n\nMakerere University Vice-Chancellor Prof Barnabas Nawangwe has lauded the telecommunications giant for this gesture saying it will go a long way in enabling students catch up on lost study time as they will now have access to the study materials at no cost.\n\n“Our negotiations with MTN Uganda yielded a lot of fruit as the telecom company has accepted to zero-rate six of our (Makerere University) online learning platforms. We applaud them for this. I now urge our students and lecturers to take advantage of this opportunity,” Said Prof Nawangwe when MTN first announced the offer, two weeks ago.\n\nMTN Uganda is dedicated to helping and impacting the communities positively and this is one of the ways the company is reaching out to students that may have a hard time accessing study materials on the internet because of financial constraints.\n\nLoading...\n\n(Visited 1 time, 1 visit today)\n\nShare\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTweet\n\n&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;President Museveni has nominated Dorothy Kisaka for Executive Director, Kampala City Authority (KCCA) and other officials to assume other top positions at the institution.\n\nKisaka is the Senior Presidential Advisor in the Government of Uganda, at the Office of the Prime Minister, tasked with coordinating with political and non political actors to implement public policy.\n\nShe is Deputy Head at the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit, fast-tracking service delivery on government priorities.\n\nShe now effectively replaces Jeniffer Musisi who resigned in October 2018.\n\nMuseveni also suggested that Kisaka should be deputized by former Head of Planning at Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) David Luyimbazi.\n\nThe president further nominated Daniel Okello who’s serving in acting capacity as Director Public health services and environment at KCCA to take the job.\n\nThe credibility of the letter was confirmed by Presidential spokesperson Don Wanyama.\n\n“It’s true,” he told ChimpReports on Friday night.\n\nMuseveni also asked Justice Ralph Ochan, the Chairperson Public Service Commission (PSC) to check the suitability of a one Grace Akullo as Director Human Resource.\n\nWanyama said Akullo who is mentioned in the letter to Ochan is not the current CIID boss.\n\nShe is the Assistant Commissioner Human Resource Management at Public Service Ministry.\n\nThe president said “We used integrity hunting for identify the persons mentioned above” and advised that other vacant positions should be filled by “advertising, utilizing your system.\n\nEarlier today, Museveni fired KCCA’s Acting Executive Director, Eng. Andrew Kitaka, his Deputy Samuel Sserukuma, and three other directors.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;The Kampala Capital City Authority Acting Executive Director, Eng. Andrew Kitaka, his Deputy Samuel Sserukuma and three directors have been relieved of their duties.\n\nAccording to sources, the Ministry of Public Service on Saturday wrote to relevant authorities including the Minister of Kampala Betty Amongi to inform them on the action taken against the five senior officials.\n\n“It is a total purge at the authority (KCCA). Five people fired including the acting Executive Director and his deputy,” said a source.\n\nWhen contacted on phone, Amongi declined to confirm or deny the development referring us to the Public Service Ministry.\n\n“I have no comment on any sacking. Kindly get in touch with Public Service,” said Amongi.\n\nKCCA is currently on the spot over the falsification of COVID-19 results of an employee by other senior staff members who did not like her.\n\n\n\nThe husband of the woman threatened legal action against the government but President Yoweri Museveni reportedly talked to him to drop the plans.\n\nPresident Museveni has in recent months fired or refused to renew contracts of senior officials from Uganda Revenue Authority, Immigration, Uganda Police Force and Bank of Uganda.\n\nThe President says he is uprooting corrupt and inefficient officials from top positions.\n\nIt remains unclear if the KCCA leadership was removed over corruption.\n\nHowever, the management of the city Affairs leaves a lot to be desired especially the failure to supervise the rehabilitation of roads leading to colossal loss of large sums of taxpayers’ money.\n\nKCCA also has been rocked by accusations of nepotism and intrigue.\n\nEng Kitaka was in December 2019 appointed to serve as acting KCCA Executive Director following the resignation of Jeniffer Musisi.\n\nHis reign was later extended earlier this year.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Sacked former Sanyu FM talkshow host, James Onen alias Fat Boy, has accused Rajiv Ruparelia, the son of Indian businessman Sudhir Ruparelia of throwing him out of the city radio station as a “dog.”\n\nA visibly disturbed Onen told KFM in an interview on Friday that Rajiv’s style of management left a lot to be desired.\n\n“The running of the company has been taken over by the son of the owner… Rajiv… he is the guy in charge,” said Fat Boy, arguably Uganda’s finest radio talk show host.\n\n“I’ve heard stories about his management style… I hear some good things, I hear some not good things… and I feel as though he just acted so erratically and just so carelessly,” he added.\n\nFat Boy was among Sanyu FM’s staff fired for reportedly refusing a pay cut during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Fat Boy said management simply told them, “don’t come to work for a couple of days. And then you get a letter to tell you that you guys missed work so you are fired.”\n\nFat Boy’s statement punches holes in Sudhir Ruparelia‘s narrative that the staff laid down tools hence terminating their own jobs.\n\nSudhir was quoted this week as saying management made a business decision to cost-cut so as to make the business sustainable and protect jobs.\n\n“We offered to talk and negotiate a solution but they instead chose to lay down their tools. They terminated themselves,” he said.\n\n“When you lay down the tools, you have broken contract and terminated yourself. The company has contracts on advertising and is actually making losses. If you have a contract and you stop doing that which you promised to do in the contract and you are absconding from work, in essence, you have terminated your own contract of employment,” he told CEO Magazine.\n\nHowever, Fat Boy, who commands a huge following in Uganda and overseas, said this was false.\n\n“If your boss told you don’t go to work tomorrow, what do you gonna do?” wondered Fat Boy.\n\nSeveral staff who talked to ChimpReports said Sanyu forced them out without listening to their concerns.\n\nVideo:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/933kfm/status/1271335026752356352?s=12\n\nAsked on Tweets fired off Sanyu Fm’s official Twitter handle urging lawyers to represent the troubled staff in a legal suit against Sudhir, Fat Boy said they were “baffled” as to who was tweeting.\n\n“We don’t know who tweeted. We never hacked the page. Presenters had nothing to with the tweets,” he said, urging Sanyu fm management to “contact Twitter to find out who was behind it.”\n\nOn taking on Sudhir, Rajiv and Sanyu management in court, Fat Boy, a son of departed former Trade Ministry Permanent Secretary, Amb Julius Onen, said his “phone has not stopped ringing” as lawyers ask to provide the much-needed legal support.\n\nHe said lawyers are urging staff to “Come we help, come we do something. A lot of people are rallying behind us. If action is taken, we will see what happens.”\n\nAsked if he would work for Sanyu Fm in future, Fat Boy responded: “Absolutely not. Never. Why would you want to work in a place that treats you like that? I’ve been loyal to this station. How many years of my life have I given to it. And then … he (Rajiv) kicks me out like a dog.”\n\nHe also wondered why he was not given a chance to make his case “or a fair hearing like I am trash.”\n\nFat Boy seemed to attribute the turbulence at Sanyu to Rajiv, who a few years ago sacked the entire management of Victoria University – sparking a huge public outrage and legal suit.\n\nOne of the former Victoria University dons threatened to “bring down the entire Ruparelia company if I am not paid my salary arrears.”\n\nFearing his deep connections to the state, the don, who later served with the Ministry of Energy, was promptly paid his money.\n\nRajiv under Fire\n\nFat Boy said the “reigns of the company (Sanyu) have been taken over by Sudhir’s son, Rajiv. I wish he was more willing to listen to views of moderation.”\n\nOn social media, Sanyu FM fans said the radio station was walking a tightrope by kicking out its main asset – Fat Boy.\n\nFounded in 1993 by the Katto family, Sanyu Fm was acquired by Sudhir in 1999.\n\nIt’s the oldest surviving privately owned radio station.\n\nFat Boy said the manner in which they were kicked out of the station has “potential legal problems. There is so much that is actionable here.”\n\nSpeaking about Rajiv’s conduct, Fat Boy blasted the chubby-cheeked businessman: “It’s unfortunate there was no one to reign him (Rajiv) in, to check his excesses. This story is gonna go down, it’s gonna be taught in schools as what not to do as a company when dealing with staff.”\n\nFat Boy’s said he would use his free time to work on his private projects but didn’t rule out returning to the airwaves.&#39;,

Government said he succumbed to cardiac arrest.\n\nAuthorities have not yet announced a date for Nkurunziza’s burial.&#39;,

June 2020 until burial,” Museveni directed.\n\n“President Nkurunziza was a true friend of Uganda and a champion of the East African integration; his country and the region will miss his talents and the invaluable contribution he was well-positioned to make towards the consolidation of peace and stability in Burundi and in the region, following his departure from office in a few months’ time.”\n\nMuseveni’s directive follows that of Kenya’s Uhuru Kinyatta who also ordered for his country’s flags to fly at half mast in honor of the fallen leader.\n\nNkurunziza died on Tuesday 9th June 2020.\n\nAlthough the State declared that he died of cardiac arrest, there have been rumours that he could have had COVID-19 since his wife is suffering from the same.\n\nNkurunziza who has been in power for 15 years was set to hand over the presidency to new leader Evariste Ndyayishimiye in August this year.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the fate of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Challenge League B 2020 has been hanging in the balance.\n\nIn earlier communication, the tournament was moved from July to August to allow the cricket world governing body monitor the situation in the participating nations.\n\nHowever a statement released on Thursday morning by the world Cricket governing body, ICC has put the uncertainty behind as a kickoff date decision was reached.\n\n“The International Cricket Council (ICC) has today announced the postponment of series nine of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 and the second ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Challenge League B series due to the COVID 19 pandemic. As part of the ICC’s comprehensive contingency planning across all ICC events and consultation with members, the decision has been taken to postpone both series,” read part of the statement.\n\nEach of the participating countries has been affected by the pandemic and a return to sports for some nations is still far from the reality. The travel restrictions on different nations is another reason that informed the decision.\n\nSeries nine of the Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 was to take place between 4th-11th July in Scotland with the hosts Nepal and Namibia competing in the One Day International.\n\nThe ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Challenge League B was due to take place in Uganda between 3rd and 13th August. The 15 matches where scheduled to take place in the second league B event of the competition.\n\nThe tournament was also going to feature five other teams namely Kenya, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Italy and Jersey.\n\nThe ICC will work with all participating members to identify when both series will be able to be staged.\n\nThe Cricket Cranes are currently on top of the Cricket World Cup Challenge League B table, three points ahead of second placed Hong Kong on 7 points.\n\nThe table Leader after the three rounds of the Qualifiers will move to the next round, the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup qualifier playoff in 2022.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;In honor of life of the late Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza and as a mark of respect, the Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has on Friday ordered that Kenyan flags both in Kenya and Kenyan Missions abroad and also the East African Community flag be flown at half-mast\n\n“I, Uhuru Kenyatta, under the authority vested in me as President of the Republic of Kenya, do hereby order and direct that in memory of the late President Pierre Nkurunziza and in solemn solidarity and mourning; the flag of the East African Community (EAC) and of the Republic of Kenya shall be flown at half-mast at public buildings and public grounds and wherever else throughout the entire territory of the Republic of Kenya and at all of Kenya’s Diplomatic Missions abroad from dawn on Saturday 13th June 2020 until sunset on the day of his interment,” Kenyatta ordered on Friday.\n\nNkurunziza died on Tuesday 9th June 2020.\n\nAlthough the State declared that he died of cardiac arrest, there have been rumours that he could have had COVID-19 since his wife is suffering from the same.\n\nNkurunziza who has been in power for 15 years was set to hand over the presidency to new leader Evariste Ndyayishimiye in August this year.\n\nAlthough he agreed to step down as Burundian President after the election in May, an unprecedented title of “Supreme Guide” was created and Nkurunziza was set to be Burundi’s Supreme Guide.\n\nMany believed that the title of Supreme Guide would give Nkurunziza more powers and continue governing Burundi indirectly.\n\nIn 2015, tens of thousands of Burundians were slaughtered on the streets of the country’s capital Bujumbula after they protested his move to run for another 5 year term, something which was contrary to Burundi’s Constitution.\n\nHundreds of thousands fled the country as refugees while others were incarcerated and some of them are still in jail even today.\n\nHe was 55 years at the time of his death.&#39;,

PHOTO BY TAUSI NAKATO\n\n\n\nThe Nursing officer In-charge of Isolation unit, Ms Aisha Nakawunde, urged the discharged patients to become advocates of Covid-19 in their communities through sensitisation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Taddeo Kikomeko, one of the discharged patients, appealed to security officers to stop \&#39;intimidating\&#39; Covid-19 patients while being taken to the hospital.\n\n“After my results turned out to be positive, two Police patrol vehicles were sent to pick me plus two other vehicles as if I was a thief.\n\n&#34;The public fears police and the UPDF; I’m being discharged but I fear going back because the public is likely to reject me given the way we are treated when we are being taken to the hospital,’’ he said.\n\nMr Yoweri Musimba, another discharged patient, said his employer’s vehicle survived being burnt by angry residents after police picked him from his home after he tested positive.\n\n“We appeal to police to change the way in which they pick us from our homes. When police came for me, they also took all my other family members and the home was left with nobody. The neighbours became violent and wanted to burn my employer’s vehicle,’’ he said.\n\nThe patients appreciated the frontline team for their care and hospitality and asked Government to increase their salaries.\n\nIn mid-May, health workers, treating suspected Covid-19 patents at Jinja hospital, laid down their tools over the issue of risk allowances.\n\nThey claimed they were supposed to receive Shs80, 000 and refreshment allowance of Shs15, 000 per day but they had not received money by that time.\n\nThey later resumed work after their issue was sorted out.\n\nThe patients are being treated at a former Jinja hospital mental health unit.\n\nCurrently, Uganda’s Covid-19 cases stand at 686.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By AFP\n\nConfederate monuments are coming down and statues of Christopher Columbus are being toppled as Americans grapple with the ghosts of the country\&#39;s racial history in the wake of George Floyd\&#39;s death.\n\n&#34;It seems like maybe we\&#39;ve hit a tipping point in the retelling of the narrative of who we are as an American people,&#34; said David Farber, a history professor at the University of Kansas.\n\n&#34;We\&#39;re seeing tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of Americans wrestling with fundamental questions of what do we do with the unsavory -- and, let\&#39;s be frank, even immoral -- aspects of our past.&#34;\n\nThe May 25 killing of Floyd, an African American, by a white police officer in Minneapolis has ignited mass protests for racial justice and police reform across the United States.\n\nBut the death of the 46-year-old has also triggered a national soul-searching of the country\&#39;s checkered past.\n\nDemonstrators in several US cities have targeted monuments to generals and politicians of the pro-slavery Civil War South, pulling down a statue in Richmond, for example, of Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president during the 1861-1865 conflict.\n\nA statue of Christopher Columbus, which was toppled to the ground by protesters, is loaded onto a truck on the grounds of the State Capitol on June 10, 2020 in St Paul, Minnesota. AFP PHOTO\n\n&#34;The symbols of the Confederacy are, I think, the most polarizing of these memorials. But it extends all over the United States,&#34; Farber said.\n\n&#34;In New York it\&#39;s statues to Columbus. In New Mexico, there\&#39;s a statue of a conquistador who\&#39;s a genocidal figure in the eyes of the Pueblo Indian people.\n\n&#34;There\&#39;s high schools all over the United States named for John Calhoun,&#34; a former vice president who was an avowed proponent of slavery.\n\n\&#39;Public outcry\&#39;\n\nFarber noted that the debate over Confederate memorials has been going on for years and civil rights marchers of the 1950s and 1960s decried the fact that they were &#34;walking down streets named after avowed racists and white supremacists.&#34;\n\nThe efforts to remove Confederate monuments gathered momentum after a white supremacist shot dead nine African Americans at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n&#34;The pace of it is now increasing because of public demand and public outcry,&#34; said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University.\n\n&#34;What I think we\&#39;re seeing is a reexamination of lots of our assumptions and a challenging of various forms of history as it affects African Americans,&#34; Gillespie said.\n\n&#34;This is a moment where the focus is on anti-black racism but it is not excluding other forms of racial oppression,&#34; she said.\n\nProtesters kneel at an intersection to demand an end to systemic racism and police brutality in the borough of Brooklyn on June 11, 2020 in New York City.\n\nLaura Edwards, a Duke University history professor, said &#34;it\&#39;s sinking in to people that these symbols have political meaning and are problematic in ways they had not fully appreciated.\n\n&#34;It\&#39;s less easy to call this heritage, for instance,&#34; Edwards said in a reference to arguments often used by opponents of removing Confederate symbols who claim it is erasing a proud Southern history.\n\nEdwards said she was &#34;blown away&#34; when the NASCAR race car franchise banned the display of the Confederate flag at its events.\n\n&#34;Amongst all the sports it was the one that embraced what they imagined to be white Southern heritage,&#34; she said.\n\n&#34;Symbols associated with white supremacy and the Confederacy had been part of their brand.&#34;\n\n\&#39;Broader reckoning\&#39;\n\nThe toppling of Confederate statues and those of Columbus are &#34;very much related,&#34; Edwards said, in that both embody the &#34;violent colonization of the United States.&#34;\n\n&#34;The first part was Europeans coming and making claims to a place that belonged to indigenous people and then engaging in genocide to wipe them away.&#34;\n\nThat was followed by the importation of slaves from Africa -- what Alan Kraut, a history professor at American University, called &#34;the original sin that we\&#39;ve never been able to get beyond.&#34;\n\n&#34;What we\&#39;re seeing now is a revision of history in response to a political moment,&#34; Kraut said, although &#34;this reassessment has been going on for a while.&#34;\n\n&#34;Statues were already being discussed and removed,&#34; he added. &#34;George Floyd\&#39;s death served as a catalyst to do it dramatically and to do it quickly.&#34;\n\nA small group of peaceful protestors hold signs and shout slogans in memory of George Floyd and in opposition to police brutality, in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles, California, June 11, 2020.\n\n\n\nSteven White, an assistant professor of political science at Syracuse University, said people are &#34;rethinking racism in American history more broadly.&#34;\n\n&#34;You\&#39;re kind of seeing this broader reckoning,&#34; White said.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By AFP\n\nBurundi\&#39;s constitutional court on Friday ruled that the country\&#39;s newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be rapidly sworn in following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\nNkurunziza\&#39;s death on Monday, aged 55, came after the May election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, as the constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\nHowever in its judgement the court wrote that an interim period &#34;is not necessary&#34;.\n\nThe court ruled that the country must &#34;proceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye&#34;.\n\nNkurunziza, a devout evangelical who believed he was chosen by God to lead Burundi, leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi, while a personality cult grew around Nkurunziza which saw the ruling party name him a &#34;visionary&#34; and &#34;supreme guide for patriotism.&#34;\n\nUnited Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.\n\nNkurunziza\&#39;s decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.\n\nHandpicked successor\n\nHis successor Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the ruling party\&#39;s core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent. Opposition claims of widespread fraud were dismissed by the constitutional court.\n\nWhile he is also a general, Ndayishimiye is not a regime hardliner and Nkurunziza was expected to continue to play a significant role, possibly limiting the independence of his successor who is reputed to be more tolerant and open.\n\n&#34;In principle it is an opportunity for him to free himself, in the sense that we would have expected Nkurunziza to play an important role in the future,&#34; said Richard Moncrieff, an expert with the International Crisis Group (ICG).\n\nHowever some observers have said he may run into trouble with the generals if he tries to introduce reforms or improve the human rights situation in the country.\n\nAfter the news of Nkurunziza\&#39;s death Ndayishimiye vowed to &#34;continue his high-quality work that he has done for our country&#34;.\n\nA source in the French presidency said the country would work with its European partners and &#34;extend a hand to the new Burundian president&#34;.\n\n&#34;For the first time we will have a leader who is not just forging ahead regardless of the consequences, wrapped up in divine faith.&#34;\n\nQuestions over death\n\nThe government has yet to announce a date for Nkurunziza\&#39;s funeral, but is marking a seven-day period of national mourning, during which it has banned music in bars, nightclubs and karaoke, a statement said Thursday.\n\nBoth Kenya and Uganda on Friday announced they would be flying their flags at half-mast to honour Nkurunziza.\n\nThe Burundian president died of what the government said was a heart attack, however suspicion is high he may have had the new coronavirus.\n\nHis wife Denise Bucumi was hospitalised at the end of May with the virus. A medical document seen by AFP said she had tested positive for the virus and suffered &#34;respiratory distress&#34;.\n\nA medical source at the Karusi hospital where Nkurunziza died, told AFP he had also been in &#34;respiratory distress&#34; before his death.\n\nA medical source at the Kamenge university hospital in Bujumbura told AFP that the head of the institute of public health &#34;came to requisition our hospital\&#39;s only ventilator and the head of our reanimation service in the name of the presidency on Monday at 10am&#34;.\n\nBoth were flown to the hospital in Karusi, but it was &#34;too late, president Nkurunziza was already dead,&#34; a medical source in Karusi said.\n\nBurundi has largely ignored the virus outbreak, taking few measures to combat its spread compared to many of its neighbours which implemented strict lockdowns and curfews, and holding an election campaign.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By AFP\n\nLesotho\&#39;s former prime minister Thomas Thabane and his wife paid assassins a down payment of $24,000 to kill his estranged wife Lipolelo three years ago, according to a police affidavit seen on Wednesday.\n\nThe details were the latest twist in a scandal that has rocked the southern African state and prompted Thabane to resign last month under pressure over accusations he hampered the investigation.\n\nThabane and his then wife Lipolelo Thabane, 58, were in the middle of a bitter divorce when she was shot and killed outside her home two days before her husband\&#39;s 2017 inauguration.\n\nThabane has not yet been charged, but the police said he was involved in the plot to kill Lipolelo using hired killers and his wife Maesaiah is in custody accused of murder.\n\nIn an affidavit filed on Tuesday but seen by AFP on Wednesday, Deputy Commissioner of Police Paseka Mokete said Thabane and Maesaiah &#34;wanted the deceased dead so that (Maesaiah) ...could assume the position of First Lady&#34;.\n\nEx-premier &#34;Thabane physically pointed out the residence of the deceased to his co-accused,&#34; Mokete said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice have said they found Thabane\&#39;s mobile number in communications records from the crime scene.\n\nThabane has denied involvement in the murder. He married Maesaiah two months after the death of Lipolelo.\n\nThe police commissioner said the couple had promised to pay the killers the equivalent of $179,485, which was to be paid in instalments.\n\n&#34;They would be remunerated in cash... and through employment opportunities, should they carry out the murder of the deceased prior to (Thabane\&#39;s) inauguration as prime minister,&#34; Mokete said.\n\nInitial payments totalling 400,000 maloti ($23,931) were made after Lipolelo\&#39;s assassination on 14 June 2017, police said.\n\nA first attempt to kill Lipolelo failed on 12 June 2017, police said.\n\nOne of the accused killers has since turned state witness.\n\nMaesaiah, 43, was charged with murder in February and spent half a night in jail before a High Court freed her on a 1,000 maloti ($57) bail.\n\nShe returned to custody last week after a court revoked bail. She applied for fresh bail on Thursday and a hearing is scheduled for 16 June.\n\nIn the application, she sought release to allow her to take care of her &#34;critically ill&#34; husband who has &#34;been diagnosed with an advanced prostate cancer&#34; for which he underwent an operation in South Africa on 29 May 2020.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By Our writer\n\nMany small farmers in Uganda usually sell their produce at giveaway prices as middlemen often exploit them by offering low prices even when the prevailing market prices are higher.\n\nThis mainly happens because of lack of market information. However, this could soon be history, if all farmers adopt online technologies that seek to connect them to buyers.\n\nOne of such online platforms is Lusuku Online www.lusuku.ug, a fresh produce e-Market platform that gives farmers direct connection with buyers.\n\nLusuku, which in English means garden, seeks to empower local farmers and producers through connecting them to a vast pool of buyers they would not have accessed easily.\n\nAccording to Medhi Matovu, the founder and chief executive officer Lusuku Online, digital visibility offers transparency of market prices which encourages proper planning and healthy competition that benefits both the buyers and sellers.\n\n“Using our agile web application, we avail fresh products to customers delivered to and at their convenience at very competitive prices, for both bulk and small orders using our secure online payment option of Mobile Money or cash at delivery,” Matovu said.\n\nHe noted that majority of its clients are small-scale women farmers, given that most farmers in Uganda are women, who now concentrate on farming while Lusuku secures market for their produce.\n\n“We told them to concentrate on the farming and we focus on getting for them market. We give them guarantee that we shall get them a ready market,” he said.\n\nLusuku Online is one of the FinTechs participating in the 40-days-40-FinTechs initiatives organised by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop.\n\nThe initiative seeks to enable FinTechs to innovate solutions that facilitate cross-network financial transactions at minimal risks to enhance access to financial services.\n\nRunning for 40 days, the project will see the participating 40 FinTechs acquire interoperable development skills to improve access to financial services, using the Mojaloop open source software.\n\nMatovu applauded HiPipo for the 40-days-40-FinTechs project, saying it is in line with their effort of deepening financial inclusion.\n\n“We have heard about interoperability with Mojaloop and we will see how it can fit our case,” Matovu said.\n\nThe HiPipo CEO Innocent Kawooya said that the current circumstances brought by COVID-19 require that there is one functional network to ensure efficient and uninterrupted supply.\n\n“We need an effective marketing, distribution and payment network. A platform like Lusuku is prime because it is linking farmers to a direct market. We all wish to have fresh products delivered at home from the garden; Lusuku is doing that. But importantly, it is ensuring that farmers get good earnings from their harvests,” he said.\n\nKawooya said that creating a solution for farmers is noble given that Uganda is an agro-based country.\n\n“Agriculture is our backbone; it is thus important that Lusuku works on interlinks and integrations with other platforms – cards and mobile money among others. HiPipo pledges to give Lusuku unlimited publicity,” he noted.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Our Reporter.\n\nWhile financial management skills are key for the survival of any enterprise, most micro, small and medium size enterprises and savings groups lack this key aspect. This has seen many die before even celebrating their first birthdays.\n\nHowever, Computing Palace Technologies, an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) firm that specializes in software development, thinks many of these enterprises would be saved if they adopt financial management skills by simply investing in management systems.\n\nComputing Palace Technologies deals in a range of ICT oriented services including software development, development of financial products, websites design and hosting services, ICT consultancy, internship training, and customized ICT training. The firm is out to help enterprises embrace better management systems for their own survival, according to the firm’s chief executive officer Felix Balintumye.\n\nThe firm has over the years developed different management systems including Sacco management, School management, Hospital management, and Church management systems, to among others register members/clients and help them keep in touch and to monitor revenue or donations that the different organisations receive.\n\nComputing Palace Technologies is among the participants in the 40-days-40-FinTechs initiative that has been organised by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop.\n\nBalintumye said the firm competed for a slot in the project so that they can be empowered on how to integrate mobile payments in the different systems they have and the web platforms developed for their clients, who need financial payment solutions.\n\nHe said one of their latest products is an e-commerce platform, which they want to integrate using the Mojaloop software. He added that they also plan to innovate more solutions using the Mojaloop software to support women’s saving groups and saccos.\n\n“The beauty of Mojaloop is the interoperability that we want to see which can be accessed via mobile phones, especially for women.\n\n“In the interest of improving our services, we believe that Mojaloop is the right tool for us to scale up. The main challenge has always been interoperability of data. The fact that Mojaloop is actually Open Source makes it even more suitable for us,” he said.\n\nBalintumye also said that while Finance minister Matia Kasaija announced that he would provide Shs94b credit through Saccos and Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) to support micro and small-scale enterprises that have cash-flow challenges resulting from COVID-19, most of the saccos and MFIs do not have financial management skills and thus, will require their services.\n\nThe 40-days-40-FinTechs initiative seeks to enable FinTechs to innovate solutions that facilitate cross-network financial transactions at minimal risks to enhance access to financial services.\n\nRunning for 40 days, the project will see the participating 40 FinTechs acquire interoperable development skills to improve access to financial services, using the Mojaloop open source software.\n\nThe HiPipo chief executive officer Innocent Kawooya said they would ensure that they equip all the participating FinTechs with the needed skills and information to understand how Mojaloop works and connect them with experts in the sector to ensure that they understand financial technology in depth.\n\n“Part of our experienced people in Application Program Interfaces (APIs) will guide you and help you to integrate with Mobile Network Operators and banks but importantly because you have work in progress, one of the things that we will do to help is to think together, discuss and understand the solution and be able to share our advise to guide you,” he said.\n\nKawooya, a certified programmer, with over 15 years’ experience added that besides shinning a light on prime stories that are transforming millions of lives using FinTech, the project also seeks to ensure that it empowers organisations like Computing Palace Technology, which are sensitive and knowledgeable about systems and software development, to be able to think of another important avenue of development that can change things.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By Our writer\n\nWhile Uganda started efforts to boost a cashless economy over a decade ago, majority of Ugandans still prefer cash.\n\nAvailable statistics indicate that about 99 per cent of the economy is cash-based and only 1 per cent is cashless.\n\nHowever, over the years, several Financial Technology Companies (FinTechs) have heavily invested in helping Ugandans shift from a cash to a cashless economy.\n\nAmong them is Beyonic, one of the leading fintech integrators in Africa that aims to eliminate dependency on cash by helping businesses quickly set up and manage digital payments.\n\nThe software company entered the Uganda market at the end of 2005 but started operations at the beginning of 2006.\n\nSeeking to answer the question of accountability for organizations and donor bodies, the software company thought of ways of further supporting companies better manage their finances – income and expenditures by setting up a mobile payments platform in 2012 thus unlocking clean, safe, transparent cashless management of project and enterprise budgets.\n\n“There are challenges for use of cash by organizations. Beyonic came to help institutions reduce the use of cash in all their systems. We are here to support and promote a cashless efficient economy,” Ian Mubiru, the Beyonic Country Director said.\n\nHe added: “As the fintech space matured, the contrast between the simplicity promised by a digital ecosystem and the cost, complexity, and risk of cash payments became increasingly stark. Payments are hard; especially in emerging markets, and particularly in the last mile. Thus, Beyonic set out to make them easy.”\n\nAccording to Mubiru, Beyonic is helping free its clients from non-core roles so as to focus on making their businesses and communities thrive.\n\nIts solutions include access, data house and pricing services.\n\nUnder Beyonic access, it enables instructions to access over 26 telecoms from across nine countries in Africa. This means that once one connects to the Beyonic platform, they will have access to over 26 networks in the nine countries including Uganda, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya, among others, from a single sign-on.\n\nIn 2018, Beyonic processed close to 10 million mobile money transactions across its system.\n\nBeyonic was also selected as the Instant Payment Notification (IPN) Hub successor entity, effective May 1, 2020, and it is responsible for all ongoing operational aspects of the IPN Hub including future growth.\n\nThe IPN Hub was developed by the GSMA in partnership with the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and MasterCard Foundation, to provide a single point of integration between mobile money networks and PAYG service providers in Sub-Saharan Africa, accelerating reliable access to utility services at the last mile.\n\nFollowing the successful piloting and scaling of the IPN Hub, the GSMA elected to transition it to an entity that would continue to scale it sustainability and after a rigorous selection process, it was awarded to Beyonic.\n\nThe Data House solution on the other hand is used to store data that can be used for planning purposes by their different clients.\n\nMubiru said that a lot of data is out there but it is not well organised, thus Beyonic helps companies store and make sense of such data.\n\nUnder the pricing services, Mubiru said: “Payments and pricing continues to change over time. At the beginning of our journey, we were just supporting organizations but with time we found out that there was need to support fintechs and other players.”\n\n“We had already developed a lot of application program interfaces (APIs) so we decided to open them up for anyone that needed to use them. We made sure that our APIs integration is as short as possible,” he said.\n\nWhile others take three months to integrate, Mubiru said they ensured that theirs takes less than a month.\n\nHe said their APIs are being used by multiple partners including fintechs, e-commerce players, among others.\n\nWhile they currently operate in nine countries, Mubiru said the plan is to cover over 20 countries by 2023.\n\nMajority of its clients are women, mostly in agriculture. It is also working with a number of Saccos that offer loans to farmers.\n\nBeyonic is among the firms taking part in the 40-days-40-FinTech initiative, organised by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop.\n\nThe initiative seeks to enable FinTechs to innovate solutions that facilitate cross-network financial transactions at minimal risks to enhance access to financial services.\n\nThe initiative will see the participating 40 FinTechs acquire interoperable development skills to improve access to financial services, using the Mojaloop open source software.\n\nMubiru applauded HiPipo for the 40-days-40-fintechs initiative, saying the discussion of interoperability with Mojaloop is timely, as the market needs as much solutions as possible.\n\nThe HiPipo CEO – Innocent Kawooya said that Beyonic has played a great financial inclusion role in the markets where it operates.\n\n“We are glad that the Beyonic products and services are impacting thousands of people at the last mile. It fits well in the 40-days- 40-fintechs initiative because theirs is a prime story that is transforming the financial sector,” Kawooya said.\n\nHe added: “Going forward, as stakeholders we must collaborate and together develop products and services that serve our people. Alone, we may fail, but as a group, we shall overcome all road blocks and collectively serve our people.”\n\nIn addition to the 40-days-40-fintechs initiative, HiPipo is also organizing a Fintechs Landscape Exhibition in mid July 2020.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Our Reporter.\n\nAlpteq ICT Solutions is a Financial Technology Company (FinTech) with a mission to become a leader in providing homemade solutions that mostly target the underserved population.\n\nFounded in 2018, the FinTech offers a wide range of ICT solutions to women, schools and people in the informal sector, using innovative products.\n\nIt has over the last one year innovated three major products that can be easily used by the public. These are Easelend, POS UG and School Novas.\n\nEaselend is a Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (Sacco) software that is meant to help Saccos automate their day-to-day operations and finance management. Given that most Saccos operate informally, they find it difficult to manage daily operations and the software thus helps them to track members’ deposits, gives all Sacco members a credit score and helps them manage saccos expenses, thus ensuring transparency.\n\n“Most saccos are women dominated. They need support to grow because when you empower a woman, you have empowered a full nation. Easelend is the software that all these Saccos need,” The Alpteq ICT solutions Team Leader Fred Musisi says.\n\nThe POS UG product on the other hand helps small businesses easily do book keeping. It targets the sector that most people do not wish go to.\n\n“We found out that informal traders in downtown have booking keeping and expenses management challenges and that is why developed this solution,” Musisi notes.\n\nPOS UG, tracks expenses, sales and incomes of the business and helps the business to know its financial health position at every moment.\n\nAbout 100 shops in downtown Kampala are already using this product since its launch at the end of 2019. Those using it are already giving positive feedback.\n\nMusisi nonetheless notes that while the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on their rollout, they are on course.\n\nPOS UG is in the process of getting a financial management module that will enable its users to save and borrow from the POS community members.\n\nGood for Teachers, Parents and Students.\n\nAlpteq ICT solutions’ third product is School Novas, a product that helps schools manage their operations easily yet also allowing pupils to revise at their convenience.\n\n“Just like other businesses, schools also have challenges of managing finances. Remember many teachers are ladies so they are badly hit by this mismanagement,” Musisi says.\n\nHe notes that due to high demand, they are introducing an e-learning module in the School Novas product to enable students easily revise on their own at home at a subsidized cost to be done via mobile money or payments cards.\n\nMusisi applauded HiPipo for organising the 40-days-40 FinTechs initiative, saying that the project has given them a chance to learn, share ideas and also come to speed with latest technologies.\n\n“We are excited about the future of FinTechs and tech lovers in Uganda,” he says.\n\nAlpteq is one of the firms taking part in the 40-days-40-FinTech initiative, organised by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop. The firm featured on day 3 of the project.\n\nThe initiative seeks to enable FinTechs to innovate solutions that facilitate cross-network financial transactions at minimal risks to enhance access to financial services.\n\nThe initiative will see the participating 40 FinTechs acquire interoperable development skills to improve access to financial services, using the Mojaloop open source software.\n\nThe HiPipo CEO Innocent Kawooya says: “I am happy to see developers such as Alpteq thinking widely and boldly.”\n\n“The 40-days-40-FinTechs initiative was designed to tell the prime financial inclusion stories of Uganda and Africa. One of those stories is that of Alpteq team. Their three main products target a huge base – schools, informal traders, retail, wholesale shops and Saccos. Many of these are dominated by women. It is nice to see more companies targeting women,” Kawooya notes.\n\nHe notes that as an open source software, Mojaloop will help Alpteq create an interoperable payment solution that would see all its three products communicating to each other.\n\n“Mojaloop will help you break all the barriers and create one ecosystem that will benefit everyone. As HiPipo, we are ready to help Alpteq improve its products and massively roll them out. Like we always say, an economy that includes everyone, benefits everyone.”&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Our Reporter.\n\nUgandans may soon be able to access electricity on credit if Mallan Company Limited, a local Financial Technology company (FinTech) successfully launches its Yassako product soon.\n\nThe micro credit product that will enable people to top up their utility bills is being developed in partnership with Airtel, which will give them access to data for credit scoring of customers and also access to a mechanism for collections.\n\nThis was revealed by Malcolm Kastiro, the founder and chief executive officer, Mallan Company Limited during the second day of the 40-days-40-FinTechs initiative that is organized by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop.\n\nThe initiative seeks to enable FinTechs to innovate solutions that facilitate cross-network financial transactions at minimal risks to enhance access to financial services.\n\nRunning for 40 days, the project will see the participating 40 FinTechs acquire interoperable development skills to improve access to financial services, using the Mojaloop open source software.\n\nKastiro also noted that the Information and Communications Technology solutions company that specializes in value added services and advanced credit services in the mobile payments space, is also working on a payment gateway using the Mojaloop software that will innovate as many services as possible, with various options and features that users enjoy.\n\nAdditionally, he said that the FinTech is considering creating an ecosystem that enables its clients to invest their money using the platform , make payments or send money outside the country, on top of the current sending money from one mobile money account to another or from a mobile money account to a bank and vice versa.\n\nAbout Mallan\n\nMallan Company Limited was co-founded by Kastiro together with his young brother Allan. Both were pursuing their childhood dream of taking over the world.\n\nIt specialises in added value and advanced credit services with emphasis in the mobile payment space.\n\nIt offers a range of products including bulk payments, mainly for Small and Mid-sized Enterprises (SMEs) that desire to pay their employees, staff or casual labourers but who do not have the ‘Know Your Customer’ requirements to open bank Accounts. They help them do bulky payments through mobile money.\n\nKastiro applauded HiPipo for the initiative, saying it has given them publicity by showcasing their products.\n\nAdditionally, he said that HiPipo’s collaboration and partnership with Mojaloop is helping them further understand and appreciate the role of payments in financial inclusion.\n\n“HiPipo is giving us that platform that we need to get the products out there; they are giving us the platform that we need to acquire customers, and to get the necessary stakeholders on board in terms of regulation and partnerships,” Kastiro said.\n\nInnovative brains\n\nThe HiPipo CEO, Innocent Kawooya applauded Mallan for the innovative brains, saying that it has an amazing story and many forward thinking people.\n\n“One of the things that I would credit Mallan team for is that they have got an amazing and very organised team that is ready to go to the market and make a difference,” Kawooya said.\n\nHe added: “As we speak about transforming millions of lives using financial technology, one of the most important aspects of transformation is understanding and appreciating the benefits technology can do for our people and our lives.”\n\nHe also commended Mallan for building amazing interoperable solutions that will serve people at the bottom of the pyramid.\n\n“Mallan has products that work with Saccos, which are amazing; it is trying to break the traditional ways of saving money in boxes and locking it with a padlock. That is very important for us to have as a service and as a thought for an organisation like them that is in financial technology,” he noted.\n\nHe added that Mallan is already embracing the use of Mojaloop, an amazing standard that is globally accepted and which works with the Global System for Mobile Communications Association Application Program Interface specifications.\n\n“We are sure when they are developing a solution off Mojaloop, it will be interoperable, convenient, reliable and very secure because they have all those standards in the solution they are developing,” Kawooya explained.\n\nAs an ecosystem advocate, Kawooya pledged that HiPipo will support all the FinTechs that they are engaging by ensuring that they advocate for simpler regulation with the regulators and partners such as Mobile Money Operators and banks to enable them integrate much easier. He also pledged to help them on publicity so as to enable the public know the kind of products they offer.\n\nGoing forward, Mallan intends to play a great role in driving financial inclusion in Uganda, right from access to the right financial products to financial literacy and how people can interact with the different technologies available to appreciate systems and the processes.\n\nFinancial inclusion in Uganda is estimated at 78%, with formal financial inclusion estimated at 58%, according to the 2018 FinScope survey.&#39;,

Tentatively we have put the 29th of October as the opening day of the FUFA Big League season. There are some new ideas we are introducing in the form of the competition reforms whereby every FUFA Big League club will be having an U-17 team but only playing in their respective regions. The clubs have liked the idea. Can we continue playing in groups of the FUFA Big League or we join the two groups and play as one group? Those are some of the ideas we have.

Let it amateurs or professionals. You only have to record a 30 second video and share on the UBF social media pages (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). Social media likes will contribute only 40 percent and the technical personnel with help of Coach Patrick Lihanda will take 60 percent concerning skills and art in the video Moses Munagi, Uganda Boxing Federation President\n\nThe challenge will also be used to give back to the communities through prize money attached to the best performance.\n\nPrize Monies:\n\nA total kitty of Shs 2,500,000 has been staked by the federation with the winner partaking Shs 1,000,000.\n\nThe second placed will earn Shs750,000, the third shall get 500,000 and the fourth will smile home with Shs. 250,000.\n\nHow to participate:\n\nAs noted above, everyone is allowed to participate; male or female; young or aged as well as amateur or professional.\n\nStep One: Record a 30 seconds video clip with a combination of different techniques and punches while shadowboxing.\n\nThis includes the Jab punches, Hook punch (left and right), Uppercut, and footwork.\n\nStep Two: Like the Uganda Boxing Federation Facebook page and post your video on their timeline. The Uganda Boxing Federation pages on Instagram and Twitter are key in your winning if you follow and mention them in your video.\n\nStep Three: The winner will be decided by the judgment of the social media likes which will contribute 40% and the UBF technical committee will take up the 60.\n\nShadowboxing will keep the boxing die-hards actively engaged in the lockdown period\n\nAbout Shadowboxing:\n\nShadowboxing is an exercise used in the training for combat sports, especially, as its name implies, in boxing.\n\nIt is used mainly to prepare the muscles before the person training engages in stronger physical activity.\n\nIn shadowboxing, only one person is required to participate; the participant throws punches at no one in particular.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;The modern-day National Basketball League started nearly two and a half decades ago and you would think naming an all-time Ugandan team would be easy.\n\nHowever, it’s far from easy as many great players have graced the league through the eras and picking just five is tough.\n\nWe tasked Gad Eteu, a league winning coach with Falcons and Warriors who also coached the men’s national team (Silverbacks) to name his all-time starting five for Uganda.\n\nPoint Guard: Ben Komakech\n\nCity Oilers point guard Ben Komakech Credit: © Kawowo Sports | JOHN BATANUDDE\n\nEteu’s choice for a point guard is City Oilers’ number 8 Ben Komakech who has previously turned out for Power.\n\n“Koma is very composed and very good with the ball. He has a shot and it’s difficult to overlook him for any other point guard.”\n\nShooting Guard: Norman Blick\n\nNorman Blick Credit: John Batanudde\n\nFor a shooting guard, Eteu chose Norman Blick who played for Sky Jammers, Nkumba Marines, Power, Miracle Eagles, Warriors, KIU Titans and JKL Dolphins.\n\n“Ken Balyejjusa could have been good for that spot but he was around for a very short while and left. Norman dominated the league for a while and won wherever he went, you can’t ignore him so he takes the 2-position on my team.”\n\nSmall Forward: Stephen Omony\n\nStephen Omony Credit: Aisha Nakato\n\nEteu regards City Oilers forward Stephen Omony as the greatest player in the land and the former Falcons and Miracle Eagles star takes the small forward position.\n\n“The 3-position is the most obvious, it’s ultimately Omony. How can you not have the greatest player on your team?”\n\nPower Forward: Wilbrod Oketcho (RIP)\n\nWilbrod Oketcho Credit: Basketball 256\n\nThe decade Wilbrod Oketcho spent at Power before his demise in 2008 convinced Eteu on who the power forward of his team should be.\n\n“When I think of big men obviously names like Wilbrod Oketcho (RIP), Kenneth Ebanyat, Mark Eperu, James Omedo pop up but I will go with Oketcho as the power forward.\n\n“His combination with Ken was the most dangerous and had one of the quickest releases in the low post.”\n\nCenter: Henry Malinga\n\nHenry Malinga attempts to lay-in during the game against Tunisia at the 2015 Afrobasket Credit: FIBA\n\nFor a center, Eteu went for JKL Lady Dolphins coach Henry Malinga who played for Falcons, Warriors, KIU Titans and JKL Dolphins.\n\n“Henry Malinga does not need a lot of introduction. He mastered his post play and has some of the best footwork I have seen in Uganda along with Oketcho and Steve. So Henry takes the number five spot on the team.”&#39;,

PHOTO BY TAUSI NAKATO\n\n\n\nThe Nursing officer In-charge of Isolation unit, Ms Aisha Nakawunde, urged the discharged patients to become advocates of Covid-19 in their communities through sensitisation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Taddeo Kikomeko, one of the discharged patients, appealed to security officers to stop \&#39;intimidating\&#39; Covid-19 patients while being taken to the hospital.\n\n“After my results turned out to be positive, two Police patrol vehicles were sent to pick me plus two other vehicles as if I was a thief.\n\n&#34;The public fears police and the UPDF; I’m being discharged but I fear going back because the public is likely to reject me given the way we are treated when we are being taken to the hospital,’’ he said.\n\nMr Yoweri Musimba, another discharged patient, said his employer’s vehicle survived being burnt by angry residents after police picked him from his home after he tested positive.\n\n“We appeal to police to change the way in which they pick us from our homes. When police came for me, they also took all my other family members and the home was left with nobody. The neighbours became violent and wanted to burn my employer’s vehicle,’’ he said.\n\nThe patients appreciated the frontline team for their care and hospitality and asked Government to increase their salaries.\n\nIn mid-May, health workers, treating suspected Covid-19 patents at Jinja hospital, laid down their tools over the issue of risk allowances.\n\nThey claimed they were supposed to receive Shs80, 000 and refreshment allowance of Shs15, 000 per day but they had not received money by that time.\n\nThey later resumed work after their issue was sorted out.\n\nThe patients are being treated at a former Jinja hospital mental health unit.\n\nCurrently, Uganda’s Covid-19 cases stand at 686.&#39;,

But it extends all over the United States,&#34; Farber said.\n\n&#34;In New York it\&#39;s statues to Columbus. In New Mexico, there\&#39;s a statue of a conquistador who\&#39;s a genocidal figure in the eyes of the Pueblo Indian people.\n\n&#34;There\&#39;s high schools all over the United States named for John Calhoun,&#34; a former vice president who was an avowed proponent of slavery.\n\n\&#39;Public outcry\&#39;\n\nFarber noted that the debate over Confederate memorials has been going on for years and civil rights marchers of the 1950s and 1960s decried the fact that they were &#34;walking down streets named after avowed racists and white supremacists.&#34;\n\nThe efforts to remove Confederate monuments gathered momentum after a white supremacist shot dead nine African Americans at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n&#34;The pace of it is now increasing because of public demand and public outcry,&#34; said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University.\n\n&#34;What I think we\&#39;re seeing is a reexamination of lots of our assumptions and a challenging of various forms of history as it affects African Americans,&#34; Gillespie said.\n\n&#34;This is a moment where the focus is on anti-black racism but it is not excluding other forms of racial oppression,&#34; she said.\n\nProtesters kneel at an intersection to demand an end to systemic racism and police brutality in the borough of Brooklyn on June 11, 2020 in New York City.\n\nLaura Edwards, a Duke University history professor, said &#34;it\&#39;s sinking in to people that these symbols have political meaning and are problematic in ways they had not fully appreciated.\n\n&#34;It\&#39;s less easy to call this heritage, for instance,&#34; Edwards said in a reference to arguments often used by opponents of removing Confederate symbols who claim it is erasing a proud Southern history.\n\nEdwards said she was &#34;blown away&#34; when the NASCAR race car franchise banned the display of the Confederate flag at its events.\n\n&#34;Amongst all the sports it was the one that embraced what they imagined to be white Southern heritage,&#34; she said.\n\n&#34;Symbols associated with white supremacy and the Confederacy had been part of their brand.&#34;\n\n\&#39;Broader reckoning\&#39;\n\nThe toppling of Confederate statues and those of Columbus are &#34;very much related,&#34; Edwards said, in that both embody the &#34;violent colonization of the United States.&#34;\n\n&#34;The first part was Europeans coming and making claims to a place that belonged to indigenous people and then engaging in genocide to wipe them away.&#34;\n\nThat was followed by the importation of slaves from Africa -- what Alan Kraut, a history professor at American University, called &#34;the original sin that we\&#39;ve never been able to get beyond.&#34;\n\n&#34;What we\&#39;re seeing now is a revision of history in response to a political moment,&#34; Kraut said, although &#34;this reassessment has been going on for a while.&#34;\n\n&#34;Statues were already being discussed and removed,&#34; he added. &#34;George Floyd\&#39;s death served as a catalyst to do it dramatically and to do it quickly.&#34;\n\nA small group of peaceful protestors hold signs and shout slogans in memory of George Floyd and in opposition to police brutality, in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles, California, June 11, 2020.\n\n\n\nSteven White, an assistant professor of political science at Syracuse University, said people are &#34;rethinking racism in American history more broadly.&#34;\n\n&#34;You\&#39;re kind of seeing this broader reckoning,&#34; White said.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By AFP\n\nBurundi\&#39;s constitutional court on Friday ruled that the country\&#39;s newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be rapidly sworn in following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\nNkurunziza\&#39;s death on Monday, aged 55, came after the May election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, as the constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\nHowever in its judgement the court wrote that an interim period &#34;is not necessary&#34;.\n\nThe court ruled that the country must &#34;proceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye&#34;.\n\nNkurunziza, a devout evangelical who believed he was chosen by God to lead Burundi, leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi, while a personality cult grew around Nkurunziza which saw the ruling party name him a &#34;visionary&#34; and &#34;supreme guide for patriotism.&#34;\n\nUnited Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.\n\nNkurunziza\&#39;s decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.\n\nHandpicked successor\n\nHis successor Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the ruling party\&#39;s core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent. Opposition claims of widespread fraud were dismissed by the constitutional court.\n\nWhile he is also a general, Ndayishimiye is not a regime hardliner and Nkurunziza was expected to continue to play a significant role, possibly limiting the independence of his successor who is reputed to be more tolerant and open.\n\n&#34;In principle it is an opportunity for him to free himself, in the sense that we would have expected Nkurunziza to play an important role in the future,&#34; said Richard Moncrieff, an expert with the International Crisis Group (ICG).\n\nHowever some observers have said he may run into trouble with the generals if he tries to introduce reforms or improve the human rights situation in the country.\n\nAfter the news of Nkurunziza\&#39;s death Ndayishimiye vowed to &#34;continue his high-quality work that he has done for our country&#34;.\n\nA source in the French presidency said the country would work with its European partners and &#34;extend a hand to the new Burundian president&#34;.\n\n&#34;For the first time we will have a leader who is not just forging ahead regardless of the consequences, wrapped up in divine faith.&#34;\n\nQuestions over death\n\nThe government has yet to announce a date for Nkurunziza\&#39;s funeral, but is marking a seven-day period of national mourning, during which it has banned music in bars, nightclubs and karaoke, a statement said Thursday.\n\nBoth Kenya and Uganda on Friday announced they would be flying their flags at half-mast to honour Nkurunziza.\n\nThe Burundian president died of what the government said was a heart attack, however suspicion is high he may have had the new coronavirus.\n\nHis wife Denise Bucumi was hospitalised at the end of May with the virus. A medical document seen by AFP said she had tested positive for the virus and suffered &#34;respiratory distress&#34;.\n\nA medical source at the Karusi hospital where Nkurunziza died, told AFP he had also been in &#34;respiratory distress&#34; before his death.\n\nA medical source at the Kamenge university hospital in Bujumbura told AFP that the head of the institute of public health &#34;came to requisition our hospital\&#39;s only ventilator and the head of our reanimation service in the name of the presidency on Monday at 10am&#34;.\n\nBoth were flown to the hospital in Karusi, but it was &#34;too late, president Nkurunziza was already dead,&#34; a medical source in Karusi said.\n\nBurundi has largely ignored the virus outbreak, taking few measures to combat its spread compared to many of its neighbours which implemented strict lockdowns and curfews, and holding an election campaign.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;By AFP\n\nLesotho\&#39;s former prime minister Thomas Thabane and his wife paid assassins a down payment of $24,000 to kill his estranged wife Lipolelo three years ago, according to a police affidavit seen on Wednesday.\n\nThe details were the latest twist in a scandal that has rocked the southern African state and prompted Thabane to resign last month under pressure over accusations he hampered the investigation.\n\nThabane and his then wife Lipolelo Thabane, 58, were in the middle of a bitter divorce when she was shot and killed outside her home two days before her husband\&#39;s 2017 inauguration.\n\nThabane has not yet been charged, but the police said he was involved in the plot to kill Lipolelo using hired killers and his wife Maesaiah is in custody accused of murder.\n\nIn an affidavit filed on Tuesday but seen by AFP on Wednesday, Deputy Commissioner of Police Paseka Mokete said Thabane and Maesaiah &#34;wanted the deceased dead so that (Maesaiah) ...could assume the position of First Lady&#34;.\n\nEx-premier &#34;Thabane physically pointed out the residence of the deceased to his co-accused,&#34; Mokete said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice have said they found Thabane\&#39;s mobile number in communications records from the crime scene.\n\nThabane has denied involvement in the murder. He married Maesaiah two months after the death of Lipolelo.\n\nThe police commissioner said the couple had promised to pay the killers the equivalent of $179,485, which was to be paid in instalments.\n\n&#34;They would be remunerated in cash... and through employment opportunities, should they carry out the murder of the deceased prior to (Thabane\&#39;s) inauguration as prime minister,&#34; Mokete said.\n\nInitial payments totalling 400,000 maloti ($23,931) were made after Lipolelo\&#39;s assassination on 14 June 2017, police said.\n\nA first attempt to kill Lipolelo failed on 12 June 2017, police said.\n\nOne of the accused killers has since turned state witness.\n\nMaesaiah, 43, was charged with murder in February and spent half a night in jail before a High Court freed her on a 1,000 maloti ($57) bail.\n\nShe returned to custody last week after a court revoked bail. She applied for fresh bail on Thursday and a hearing is scheduled for 16 June.\n\nIn the application, she sought release to allow her to take care of her &#34;critically ill&#34; husband who has &#34;been diagnosed with an advanced prostate cancer&#34; for which he underwent an operation in South Africa on 29 May 2020.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;The number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the country has risen to 679 after 14 people tested positive for the disease. The 14 were among 2,321 samples that were tested on Wednesday.\n\nEight of the cases were from the community; three were from Kampala, four from Amuru and Dokolo, one was from Moyo, while six were from Ugandan truck drivers and were picked at points of entry.\n\nAdditionally, 30 foreign truck drivers were sent back to their countries of origin after they tested positive at the border points. The rise in community cases and poor adherence to measures that include wearing of masks has raised concerns among health authorities.\n\nWhile flagging off the distribution of masks on Wednesday, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the minister of Health said that they are considering reinstating the lockdown.\n\n&#34;The lockdown does not stop the spread of COVID-19 but rather allows the country to put in place systems to handle any eventualities. People are not adhering to the measures and this means the entire country might get cases and we move to Stage 4 of the outbreak,&#34; she said.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the big numbers of people moving from Kampala to go to villages or from villages to Kampala pose a threat of spreading the disease easily through the transport sector. This in addition to overcrowding at the taxi, bus parks and downtown Kampala is a cause of worry for health workers.\n\n750,000 two-layered masks will be distributed in the districts of Amuru, Busia, Kyotera, Rakai, Adjumani and Tororo. To date, 120 people have been discharged from different treatment centres in the country.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#34;A Uganda People’s Defense Forces soldier has tested positive for COVID-19. The soldier attached to Nakasongola army barracks had returned to the barracks from his pass leave and subjected to a COVID test, at Bombo military barracks.\n\nLt Ibrahim Ssekito, the Nakasongola army barracks spokesperson told URN that the soldier had gone for a medical checkup, a routine undertaken before one is redeployed after concluding his leave. He had previously travelled to Kasese district.\n\nSsekito adds that upon testing positive, the soldier was transferred to Mulago hospital for treatment. It&#39;s reported the soldier is one of three security personnel who tested positive of COVID-19 in Luweero district. Details of the attachment of the two other security personnel remain scanty.\n\nSeven of his contacts are now quarantined at Nakasongola army barracks awaiting the results from their samples which were taken to Uganda Virus Research Institute.\n\nAs a result, the barracks has directed that all soldiers who return from leave undergo mandatory quarantine under close monitoring before they resume normal duties. Ssekito reiterated that the barracks also restricted civilian visits and introduced a thermometer gun at the gate to check whoever enters the facility among other standard operating procedures aimed at controlling the spread of the virus among soldiers.\n\n69 people were also quarantined at Magamaga military barracks in Jinja district after coming into contact with a COVID-19 patient. The contacts comprise of civilians and UPDF soldiers interacted with the patient who went to the barracks to nurse her husband who suffered a mental breakdown and was admitted in the barracks&#39; health facility.\n\nThe COVID patient is now receiving treatment at the Jinja regional referral hospital isolation centre.\n\nSEVEN NEW CASES\n\nMeanwhile, Uganda&#39;s total confirmed cases have risen to 686 after seven new COVID-19 cases were confirmed by the ministry of Health. The seven new cases were part of 2,532 samples that were tested yesterday from different testing points in the country.\n\nFour of the cases were from alerts and contacts of people who have tested positive. They were picked from the districts of Tororo, Kyotera and Gulu. The other three cases were picked at the Malaba and Mutukula points of entry.\n\nGULU DISCHARGES 34 PATIENTS\n\nGulu regional referral hospital has discharged 34 patients who recovered from coronavirus disease. Of the 34 discharged patients, 26 are Ugandan truck drivers while eight are foreign truck drivers. They tested positive for the virus from Elegu border point in Amuru district.\n\nDr Paska Apiyo, a physician and the head of case management at Gulu hospital revealed that they were supposed to discharge 55 patients but the test results of the other 21 delayed at Uganda Virus Research Institute.\n\nDr James Elima, the hospital director revealed that out of the 26 Ugandan truck drivers who recovered, eight are residents of Wakiso, three from Kayunga, two from Soroti, two from Masaka and one each from the districts of Bukedia, Kyotera, Adjumani, Kitgum, Kanungu, Amuru, Iganga, Mukono, Jinja, Kamuli, and Hoima.\n\nElima adds that the surveillance team from the hospital is working closely with the different district COVID-19 task forces in the region in contact tracing and admittance of positive cases.\n\nMaj Santos Okot Lapolo, Gulu resident district commissioner and chairman Gulu district COVID-19 taskforce appealed to the members of the community to stop stigmatizing people who have recovered.\n\nHe also asked those discharged to return home and sensitize the community to observe the COVID-19 preventive measures. This brings to the total number of COVID-19 recoveries from Gulu hospital to 43.&#34;,

Kateeba also said that the government has approved Shs 48 billion to purchase 8 locomotives.\n\n“In the immediate term, the government has allocated Shs 9.5 billion to do minimum repairs on the line and equipment to immediately improve the performance of the railway to reduce the number of trucks on the road. These funds are expected to be received in a week” Kateeba says.\n\nHowever, the minister of Works and Transport Joy Kabatsi says that the rehabilitation will only start when there is availability of funds. She says that they will get some allocations in the budget, but she is not sure of the amount. According to Kateeba, the corporation has accumulated several debts as a result of low operations.\n\nThese include; Shs 1.2 billion NSSF debt, Shs 567 million for May salaries, Shs 850 million for outstanding tax obligations, Shs 500 million for medical and goods, money owed to other creditors worth Shs 1.4 billion.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#34;He wrote his script, acted and directed the movie, that premiered on Hero&#39;s Day. Finally, the General had gone. Finally, because for a number of times he had been announced dead by the reckless social media, declaring death without caring about family and friend’s feelings.\n\nImagine those who threw parties to celebrate their enemy&#39;s demise only to find out that the General was actually still alive! Imagine the horror that would engulf the jubilant hater on realising that the General if still alive, and what he would do to the hater. The script changed on Monday, June 3, 2020. The General was tired and could fight no more.\n\nGrowing up, Maj Gen Kasirye Ggwanga was extremely stubborn, it is surprising he didn&#39;t end up in Kampiringisa, where many stubborn kids were taken for straightening, so we were told. A dreaded place, whose mere mention would send chills down children&#39;s spines.\n\nWasswa as most of us grew up calling him was a handful to teachers. Our high school days were full of action. Attending teenagers&#39; dances almost every Saturday and Sunday at New Life, Mengo later renamed Economic Night Club after the exodus of Indians and Pakistanis in 1972.\n\nWasswa loved dancing and was a regular at Afrigo band&#39;s performances. Ggwanga to many who knew him was an enigma. But he was shy, yes very shy for those who knew him. The shades he donned masked his shyness. Without shades, he would feel naked and disarmed. He was a human magnet, wherever he was, crowds would gather to hear what he had to say, and he never disappointed.\n\nKasirye Ggwanga reviewing some of Nuwa&#39;s art pieces\n\nHe loved people and would do anything to help where and whenever he could. He loved children, all children biological or non.\n\nDid I mention that he also loved and collected my art? Well, he did, and would occasionally drop in at my studio/gallery for a visual feast and chat. He was always in search of knowledge through reading and watching TV. He would go on and try to implement what he would have read and seen! Sometimes to disastrous results.\n\nAs a teenager, he would stir up things and when the fight broke out he would disappear in thin air. However, that changed drastically after the basic military training in 1972 in Bombo Military wing. He became extremely fearless and daring.\n\nThe 1979 war, followed by two years of detention in Tanzania and the years he spent in the bush fighting the murderous Obote regime shaped his view of life in terms of what was, is and should be. And when the opportunity to try his luck on the ballot box came, he jumped on it. Kasirye was unanimously elected political head of Mubende District but preferred to be referred to as governor as opposed to chairman according to the Ugandan constitution.\n\nWhy the governor title? Of course, the American influence, where he had spent a whole year attending a course at Fort Leavenworth Staff and Command College, and too, growing up we had watched a lot of American movies especially Cowboy ones aka Western movies. He also believed in the federal system of government. To many, especially those with roots in Mubende, he remained the Governor until his death.\n\nHe loathed hypocrites, despised the corrupt, abhorred bullies and avoided idleness. He had an enormous heart with several compartments, in which anyone would fit. He was also extremely impatient with non-performers, but generous with whoever presented a need to him.\n\nAlthough he was tough looking as he appeared, Kasirye Ggwanga was an extremely emotional man and would breakdown at the news of the passing on of a beloved one! And such occasions were many! Man Nowa (Nuwa) tuggwaawo! He would say.\n\nThe most amazing thing is that he was loved by many from near and far including those who had never met him and only knew him through his pronouncements in the media. Then there were those who resented him because of his lack of sugar-coated utterances. He said what he meant and meant what he said. That was Kasirye Ggwanga!\n\nThe President and Commander in Chief, while delivering a Hero&#39;s national address interrupted his speech to announce the passing on of a hero, in real-time! He ordered the entire nation to observe a moment of silence in the General&#39;s honour! The nation obliged and soon there was an outpouring of grief at the confirmation of Ggwanga&#39;s death.\n\nIf indeed people love him, going by the number of outpouring emotions following his passing, then let every mourner plant a tree in his honour and memory. And may the powers that be declare total war on all those engaged in environmental degradation, land grabbing and corruption in any form. Here I must aver, Corruption is getting what you don&#39;t deserve whichever way. Oh, how I wish a forest would be planted in his honour and a compilation of his sayings be published into a book.\n\nI thank the Almighty God for according me the privilege and the honour of meeting, getting to know and sharing a lot with Maj Gen Wasswa Kasirye Ggwanga. The General lived up to the Namukozi motto: Okutya nsonyi; Obuzira kitiibwa. Loosely translated: cowardice is shameful; Bravery is honourable.\n\nMajor General, Brigadier, Colonel Kasirye Ggwanga as many civilians would fondly call you, believing Colonel was your first name and Brigadier a nickname; you didn&#39;t live in vain.\n\nRest in peace my friend, My Brother.&#34;,

This statement, therefore, summarizes the economic policy underlying the Budget estimates. It is with pleasure, that I deliver this speech on behalf of H.E. the President.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMadam Speaker, today, we face unprecedented times. The global Corona Virus pandemic has, without exception, impacted lives and economic activity across the world. The pandemic has worsened the effects of climate change and the locust invasion that Uganda and the region had already been grappling with.\n\nUganda has been reasonably successful in dealing with these emergencies. Allow me to commend His Excellency the President for his visionary leadership in the fight against these natural disasters and emergencies.\n\nMadam Speaker, these emergencies have adversely impacted the economy. The livelihoods of many Ugandans have been negatively affected with declining household incomes, and in some cases the loss of jobs and food insecurity. Economic activity has drastically declined, with reduced demand for agricultural produce, the disruption of input supplies to manufacturers, as well as a disruption of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) activities. Inflows of Foreign Direct Investment and remittances of Ugandans in the diaspora have also declined sharply.\n\nMadam Speaker, the crises we have recently faced cannot, however, distract us from our long-term development strategy. These emergencies, indeed, present several lessons and opportunities that we have drawn on to craft the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy I will elaborate today. These opportunities include the following:-\n\nThe acceleration of our import substitution and export promotion strategy for a range of goods including medicines and other health products; and the products of agro-industrialization and light manufactures, which Uganda can produce with a comparative advantage;\n\nDigitalization of many aspects of socio-economic activity to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This can be applied through e-Commerce; e-Government (including tele-conferencing, procurement and the dispensation of justice); e-Learning; robotic automation, artificial intelligence, cyber security and cloud computing; and digital marketing in tourism. This permits to fast-track implementation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR);\n\nStrengthening contingency planning to mitigate the impact of disasters, and protect the most vulnerable persons;\n\nTransforming Informality of doing business to being formal\n\nReform of Urban Transport to reduce congestion, starting with the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area and eventually Regional Cities;\n\nDomestic tourism stimulation to encourage many Ugandan residents to explore local touristic destinations.\n\nMadam Speaker, we shall therefore seize these opportunities and continue on our path to developing an integrated, self-sustaining economy as laid out in the NRM Ten Point Programme. Uganda will also actively promote the development of African and global markets to enable access by Uganda entrepreneurs. The NRM Government shall therefore profitably add value to the range of agricultural products and minerals that Uganda is endowed with, as guided by H.E. the President in the State of Nation Address.\n\nWe shall build a strong and durable economy addressing the eight fundamental human needs namely; Food, Clothing, Shelter, Defence, Human Resource Development (Health and Education), infrastructure (electricity, roads, rail, ICT, Telecoms), and Spirituality. This will establish a firm basis for Service industries such as tourism, hospitality (hotels, bars, night clubs, casinos, etc) as well as entertainment (concerts, sports, etc) to flourish.\n\nMadam Speaker, the budget has therefore been based on the following theme: ‘Stimulating the Economy to safeguard Livelihoods, Jobs, Businesses and Industrial Recovery.’\n\nMadam Speaker, in my statement today, I will therefore do the following:-\n\nTake stock of progress in Economic and Social Transformation that forms the foundation for Uganda’s resilience in the face of the emergencies we have faced and continue facing;\n\nPresent the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy; and\n\nPresent the financing framework underpinning the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy.\n\nProgress In Economic and Social Transformation\n\nMadam Speaker, the NRM Government has taken great strides to establish a strong foundation for economic and social transformation over the last five years during the implementation of the Second National Development Plan (NDPII). The strong foundation we see today has built the resilience we can see in the face of emergencies that we have recently faced. I will highlight some of the achievements we have registered in this regard, before spelling out the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy:-\n\nNational Output\n\nMadam Speaker, the Uganda economy has continued to grow, despite the effects of the recent emergencies we have faced. Uganda’s GDP in the year 2019/20 is estimated to amount to U. Shs. 138 Trillion. The economy is estimated to grow by 3.1 percent this financial year ending 30th June 2020, slower than the average growth rate of 5.4 percent in the previous four years. Had it not been the emergencies we have faced in the last six months, the rate of economic growth would have been at least 6 percent per annum.\n\nThe Agriculture sector grew by 4.2 percent up from 3.8 percent in the previous four years. However, Industry grew by only 2.3 percent compared to an annual average of 7 percent in the previous four years. Services grew by 3.6 percent over the year compared to the annual average of 5.6 percent in the previous four years. These statistics demonstrate the effect of the recent emergencies that the country has faced. Despite the temporary shocks the medium term outlook for economic growth is positive and will be stronger given the measures we will implement.\n\nPrimary Production\n\nMadam Speaker, substantial progress has been made in Primary Production. The Agriculture sector plays a central role in Uganda’s economy. It accounts for 45 percent of exports, and employs 64 percent of all Ugandans and 72 percent of all youths, thus its importance to influencing household incomes.\n\nPrimary production of commodities has increased significantly. Coffee production increased from 5.7 million 60-kg bags to 7 million bags between 2017 and 2019. Fish catches have grown from 391,000 Metric Tons to 561,000 Metric Tons between 2017 and 2019. This was largely as a result of the strict enforcement of fisheries regulations and addressing challenges of poor quality fingerlings and limited access to feeds. A total of 13,800 acres of sugar cane have also been established at the Atiak Sugar Factory in Northern Uganda and more is planned when the Amuru project starts.\n\nHuman Capital Development\n\nMadam Speaker, the wellbeing of Ugandans has also improved significantly over the years. For instance:-\n\nThe literacy rate of Ugandans in 2018 increased to 74 percent of all adults compared to 72 percent in 2014;\n\nMaternal mortality have reduced to 336 per 100,000 births from 438 per 100,000 births in 2011; and under-five child mortality has reduced to 64 per 1,000 births from 137 per 1,000 births in 2011\n\nAccess to safe water in rural areas today is at 69 percent increasing from 65 percent in 2015; with 38,500 villages representing 66 percent of the total 58,000 villages in the country having been provided clean water.\n\nAccess to safe water in urban areas stands at 79 percent, compared to 77 percent in 2015, with the piped water main network increasing from 17,600 Kilometres to 20,200 Kilometres. Over 66,000 new customers were connected during the year, bringing the total number of connections to over 720,000\n\nRural sanitation coverage is at 79 percent; while sanitation in urban areas increased to 87 per cent\n\nEconomic Infrastructure\n\nPower: Madam Speaker, we continue to make long strides in developing Economic Infrastructure. Witness this:- Electricity generation capacity now stands at 1,254 Megawatts, with the completion of the 42 Mega Watt Agago-Achwa II, the 76 Mega Watt Kyambura and the 5.9 Mega Watt Ndugutu Power projects. The 183 Mega Watt Isimba Power Project and its transmission lines was commissioned and the 600 Mega Watt Karuma Power Project is 98 percent complete and is due for commissioning in November 2020. The Karuma - Kawanda Transmission Line is also 82 percent complete. Construction of Nyagak III Power Project also resumed in May 2019.\n\nThe electrification of industrial parks has also progressed with the commissioning of the Mukono and Iganga Industrial Parks sub-stations. Under the Rural Electrification programme, 14,820 kilometres of medium-voltage power lines and 10,280 kilometres of low voltage distribution power lines have been constructed. Since we launched the free Electricity Connections Policy in November 2018, 277,500 rural households have been connected with a target to connect 300,000 rural households annually.\n\nTransport: Madam Speaker, transport infrastructure has improved considerably with the stock of the paved national road network today totalling 5,600 kilometres increasing from 4,300 Kilometres in 2015. The meter gauge railway network is under rehabilitation. The railway currently facilitates transportation of 18,000 tons of cargo monthly, and 2,000 passengers daily in order to support decongestion in Greater Kampala. In the air transport sector, thirteen (13) aerodromes have been rehabilitated countrywide and the expansion of the Entebbe International and the construction of the Kabale International Airports are progressing as scheduled. Uganda Airlines is revived and began operations during the month of August 2019.\n\nInformation and Communication Technology: Madam Speaker, ICT services have also performed well over the period. Internet users have increased from 7.5 million in 2016 to 11 million in March 2020. Total telephone subscriptions, of which mobile connections constitute 60 percent, increased from 21 million in 2016 to 28 million in January 2020. The value of Mobile money transactions increased from 3.4 Trillion in 2016 to 7.2 Trillion in March 2020.\n\nThe National Backbone Infrastructure now covers forty-nine (49) districts, 480 Ministries, Agencies and Local Governments, and 7 border posts. The monthly average unit cost of internet bandwidth for One Megabite per second (1Mbps) on the Backbone has reduced from $300 to US$70. The 500-seater ICT Innovation Hub at Nakawa was also completed during the year. Furthermore, one hundred seventy two (172) ICT Innovators were supported under the National ICT Initiatives Programme (NIISP) to develop e-Solutions. Some of their software applications have been used for business continuity during the Corona Virus lockdown.\n\nPosta Uganda launched Community Information Centres in Kitgum, Kasese, Moroto and Mubende to enhance provision of information on government services and programs. Posta Uganda also successfully implemented the International Postal System (IPS) at Forty-eight 48 District Post Offices, enabling improvement in international and national operational efficiency in timely exchange of post.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation: Madam Speaker, in the Science, Technology and Innovation Sector, core projects have, too progressed well. For example, the Machining Manufacturing and Industrial Skills Training Centre (MMISTC) at Namanve was commissioned in January 2020. The centre will provide industrial skills training and apprenticeship, and manufacture high quality precision machine parts and accessories.\n\nMadam Speaker, the first phase of the construction of the Kiira Vehicle Plant at the Jinja Industrial Park is 50 percent complete, and two (2) Kayoola Electric Buses have since been developed, assembled and tested under a Technology Transfer project with China High-Tech Corporation.\n\nGovernance\n\nMadam Speaker, to improve urban security, Phase One of the Safe City CCTV project has been rolled out in Kampala Metropolitan, Wakiso, Mukono &amp; Entebbe. Crime surveillance has also been enhanced with the deployment of LDUs across the country. The UPF also conducted Electronic Profiling of guns which will help to curb gun-related crimes. Consequently, crime levels reduced by 9.8% from 238,746 cases reported in 2018 to 215,224 cases in 2019.\n\nMadam Speaker, to increase access to justice we have established One Stop Justice Law and Order Sector Centres, each consisting of a court, and Police services, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Prison Reception centres, Probation and Community Services, in 84 districts across the country. In addition, plea bargaining was instituted to decongest court and improve the court efficiency. Consequently, cases aged over 3 years old have reduced from 24% in 2017 to 17% in 2019.\n\nMadam Speaker, to improve public service delivery, systems across Government have been developed and integrated as follows:-\n\nthe e-visa/works permits systems and the integrated Border Management System is now operational at 11 border posts and was extended to 17 Uganda Missions abroad that can issue visas to intending visitors. Consequently, average monthly visa applications have increased from 4,500 applications in 2016 to 12,700 applications in 2019;\n\nelectronic-passports have been integrated with the National Identification and Registration Agency (NIRA) register leading to a reduction in passport issuance from 10 working days in 2016 to 4 working days today;\n\nbusiness registration now takes four hours; and\n\nService Uganda Centres have been established at 18 Zonal Offices to eliminate bureaucracy and reduce cost of doing business.\n\nMadam Speaker, the fundamental progress in the socio-economic transformation of Uganda that I have highlighted is a result of the NRM Government’s holistic development strategy. This socio-economic progress provides an underlying resilience to Uganda’s economy, which has enabled us withstand the temporary disruption of the Corona Virus pandemic, the locust invasion, and the effects of Climate Change.\n\nEconomic Stimulus and Growth Strategy\n\nMadam Speaker, the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy that the NRM Government will implement commencing next financial year and in the medium term, is aimed at achieving the following three key objectives:-\n\nImproving wellbeing of Ugandans;\n\nBoosting economic transformation; and\n\nImproving peace, security and good governance\n\nMadam Speaker, these objectives address the three most critical aspects of Uganda society namely:- the peoples’ welfare, the viability of farms and businesses, and the social eco-system in which they exist and is a major determinant of their future prospects. I will now detail interventions in each of them in turn.\n\nImproving Wellbeing of Ugandans\n\nMadam Speaker, in pursuit of improving the wellbeing of Ugandans, Government has identified interventions that address their welfare, namely:- (i) Food Security and Good Nutrition (ii)Enhanced Healthcare provision (iii); Ensuring Universal access to Water and Sanitation; (iv) Increasing Social Protection for the most vulnerable population; and (v) Transforming Education Delivery. I will now detail the specific measures to be implemented in each area.\n\nFood Security and Good Nutrition\n\nMadam Speaker, the Corona Virus pandemic has brought to the fore the need to ensure adequate food security and nutrition. Food security and adequate nutrition is of paramount importance for a healthy and productive life and it is a major factor in healthcare as it reduces the burden of preventable diseases and malnutrition. It also contributes significantly to reduced maternal, neonatal, and child deaths.\n\nUganda is blessed with adequate rainfall and arable land which provides the necessary condition for agricultural production, adverse climatic conditions notwithstanding. The 14 products that have been identified by H.E. the President, will therefore be developed commercially. These products are maize, cassava, banana, beans, Irish potato, sweet potato, millet, sugar cane, cattle (beef), dairy, coffee, tea, cocoa and fish. To reduce post-harvest loses, the construction of storage facilities of 42,000 Metric Tonnes capacity that commenced in Iganga, Isingiro, Amuru, Kalungu, and Nebbi will continue.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to improve Nutrition, Government will aggressively implement programmes to ensure adequate sensitization and awareness of all Ugandans on the benefits out of good nutrition for their health and wellbeing. I would like to encourage all Ugandans to embrace healthy living through nutrition, wellness and active living. All Ugandans should place due emphasis on physical and mental activity by exercising regularly and making healthy choices of food, and by reading and writing.\n\nEnhanced Healthcare provision\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to promote health for all Ugandans, Government will strengthen health systems. In this regard, health spending has been increased to ensure the recruitment of additional health workers and also provide for their welfare.\n\nIn order to deal with the Corona Virus pandemic and other similar epidemics that may occur in the future, Government has prioritized the purchase of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Additional funding has been provided to increase Intensive Care beds at National and Regional Referral Hospitals. Funding has been availed to procure Corona Virus test kits and other materials in order to curb the spread of the virus and ensure readiness for possible secondary waves of infections, if they should occur. Government will enhance surveillance and decentralisation of management of the Corona Virus in the country. Government will also support scientific research and innovations especially in vaccine development.\n\nMadam Speaker, further measures to strengthen health systems include the following:-\n\nUndertake mass sensitization and awareness on immunization, the use of mosquito nets to prevent malaria, HIV/AIDS prevention and the prevention and management of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD);\n\nDevelop Centres of Excellence for delivery of specialized medical care by completing the construction of the Uganda Heart Institute, establish centres for cancer treatment at Regional Referral Hospitals; and commission the Regional Hospital for Paediatric Surgery at Entebbe and fast-track construction of the International Specialised Hospital of Uganda at Lubowa;\n\nStrengthen the supply chain for medicines and medical supplies to improve the availability of medicines and ensure accountability thereof. Many of these medicines will be manufactured in Uganda; and\n\nEnsure Health Centres IIIs are functional with health workers, basic medical equipment, supplies and medicines. The total number of functional health centre IIIs is 1,327 and 41 health centre IIs are being upgraded to health centre IIIs next financial year.\n\nEnhance access to Safe Water and Sanitation and Utilities\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to ensure universal access to safe and clean water and improved sanitation, we will consolidate and build on achievements I reported earlier by undertaking the following interventions, details of which are in the Background to the Budget:-\n\nConstruct nine (9) Gravity Flow Schemes (GFS), Forty (40) solar powered Water Supply Systems; and drill four hundred and fifty-five (455) water wells;\n\nConstruct thirty (30) Water Supply and Sanitation Systems; develop Bulk Water Transfer Master Plans and Designs for fifteen (15) Water Supply and Sanitation Systems;\n\nConstruct twelve (12) small scale solar power irrigation schemes, twenty (20) parish-level and thirty (30) small scale irrigation schemes;\n\nIntensify monitoring and forecasting of weather and water levels, floods and effectively disseminate information to guide policy actions by stakeholders; and\n\nEnforce environment protection regulations for settlements on lake shores, riverbanks, wetlands, forests and flood prone areas.\n\nProviding Emergency Social Protection\n\nMadam Speaker, Uganda’s vulnerable population, including the elderly, require protection, more especially to address the aftermath of the recent emergencies. Government will therefore prioritise targeted support to the most vulnerable groups and those at higher risks of food insecurity, old age and the chronically ill. To this end we will: -\n\nContinue to provide relief aid in response to the Corona Virus crisis, and natural disasters such as the locust invasion and climate change crisis – floods and landslides. This will allow the rehabilitation of adversely affected schools, health units, water points, and other social infrastructure and provide relief for vulnerable households affected. An allocation of U Shs 45 billion has been made towards this intervention; and\n\nRoll out the Social Assistance Grant for the Elderly (SAGE) nationwide to persons aged 80 years and above, including the elderly aged 65 years in the piloted 15 districts. An allocation of UShs. 107 billion has been made for this intervention.\n\nTransforming Education delivery\n\nMadam Speaker, education plays a central role in the development of human capital. In order to improve the effectiveness in the delivery of education, Government will prioritise the following actions: -\n\nRoll out the new education curriculum, including Early Childhood Development (ECD) curriculum;\n\nExpand access to Vocational Education and Training, including international accreditation of Business, Technical, and Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) institutions as Centres of Excellence;\n\nImprove the quality of tertiary education institutions by ensuring their adequate staffing and increasing the emphasis on academic research;\n\nEnhance teaching supervision using digital platforms in the inspection of schools through scaling up the Integrated Inspection System; and\n\nDevelop the provision of lessons through digital platforms such as TV, Radios and the Internet to ensure continuous learning and implement the electronic delivery mode in validation and distribution of self-learning materials to learners.\n\nBoosting Economic Transformation\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to boost economic recovery and make progress with our Economic Transformation agenda, the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy we will implement shall(i) Restore Household Incomes and Safeguard Jobs (ii) Re-ignite Business Activity (iii) Provide Tax Relief to Businesses; (iv) Enhance Economic Infrastructure and (v) Improve Good Governance and Maintain Security Law and Order. The specific measures that Government will implement are the following:-\n\nRestoring Household incomes and Safeguarding Jobs\n\nMadam Speaker, following the immediate adverse impact on household incomes and jobs of the emergencies we have recently faced, interventions will be implemented to increase agricultural production to ensure national food security and expand regional food exports. This measure will also sustain the supply of inputs for agro-processing. The restoration of demand for agricultural produce is key to jumpstart this process. Safeguarding Jobs and other non-farm incomes is also critical for the restoration of demand for agricultural products. These actions ultimately ensure the recovery of aggregate demand for domestic products while booting incomes for the majority of households both rural and urban.\n\nThe specific actions that will be implemented in this regard are the following:-\n\nEnhance the provision of improved agricultural inputs using NAADS e-Voucher Scheme to farmers and upscaling agriculture extension services to boost production of key agricultural commodities, for which an allocation of UShs. 300 billion has been made;\n\nCreate jobs for the vulnerable but able bodied persons affected by Corona Virus by expanding labour intensive public works in urban and peri-urban areas; for which an allocation of Ushs 130 billion has been made;\n\nProvide rainwater harvesting technologies in rural communities, implementation of solar irrigation schemes and investment in the construction of multi-purpose water reservoirs\n\nRoll-out regional and community based storage facilities to store increased agricultural products and reduce post-harvest losses; and\n\nProvide seed capital to organised special interest groups under the Youth Fund, Women Entrepreneurship Fund and the ‘Emyooga’ Talent Support scheme; for which an allocation of UShs. 256 Billion has been made.\n\nRe-Igniting Business Activity\n\nMadam Speaker, Micro, Small and Medium enterprises (MSMEs) are the backbone of Uganda’s economy, representing an estimated 85 percent of private sector companies in regard to employment. The vast majority are operated by households and have also been extremely vulnerable to the recent emergencies, as they have low cash reserves and limited access to affordable investment finance. This also applies to other manufacturing firms that have been unduly affected by the Corona Virus crisis. Restoring their economic activity therefore enhances household incomes, especially in urban areas.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to improve the availability of investment finance and the cash-flows of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and other manufacturing firms, we will implement the following measures: -\n\nProvide credit through SACCOs and Micro Finance Institutions to support micro and small-scale enterprises. I am proposing an allocation of UShs 94 billion for FY2020/21;\n\nIncrease access to credit at Uganda Development Bank to offer low interest financing to manufacturing, agribusiness and other private sector firms, for which I have provided UShs. 1,045 billion over the medium term;\n\nIncrease funding to Uganda Development Corporation for public-private partnership investments to facilitate our import substitution and export promotion strategy, for which I have provided, to start with, UShs. 138 billion;\n\nProvide for Banks to restructure loans to their borrowers who are facing liquidity constraints and provide additional liquidity on a case by case basis, as recently guided by the Bank of Uganda;\n\nReduce charges on mobile banking and mobile money transactions, to improve efficiency, reduce person-to person contact to prevent spread of the Corona Virus; and finally\n\nExpedite the payment of arrears owed by Government to private sector firms commencing July 2020, for which I have provided UShs 673 billion in order to address liquidity constraints faced by suppliers of Government. Priority will be given to Small and Medium Enterprises, cooperative societies and contractors.\n\nTax Relief to Businesses\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to further address the short term emergency liquidity requirements of businesses, boost their cash-flows, and ensure business continuity, I propose the following tax relief measures, which I will in due course present to Parliament:-\n\nDefer payment of Corporate Income Tax or Presumptive tax for Corporations and Small, Medium Enterprises (SMEs). I am deferring until September 2020, the payment of any Corporate Income Tax and Presumptive Tax due 1st April 2020 to 30th June 2020, for tax complaint businesses with a turnover of less than Shs 500 million per annum.\n\nFurthermore, no interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period. This is aimed to benefit companies and Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs) especially in tourism, manufacturing, horticulture and floriculture. The number of taxpayers benefiting from this measure for whom Corporate Incomes Tax is applicable is 10,140 and the deferred tax is estimated to be Ushs 12.5 billion. In addition, the number of tax payers benefiting from the presumptive tax measure is 23,892, and the deferred tax is estimated to be Ushs 1.38 billion.\n\nDefer payment of PAYE by sectors affected: I am deferring payment until September 2020 of PAYE due from 1st April 2020 to 30th June 2020 for tax compliant Ugandan businesses facing hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. No interest will accumulate on tax due during this period. An estimated UShs 65.35 billion due from Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for manufacturing and tourism sectors is being deferred. For floriculture sector, the expected PAYE deferral is Ushs 0.237 billion.\n\nWaive interest on tax arrears: I am waiving interest and penalties on tax arrears accumulated before 1st July 2020 to lessen the tax liability of businesses who voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. The expected tax relief as a result is Ushs 50 billion.\n\nProvide for Tax Deductibility of Donations for the Corona Virus Response. I am allowing the value of the donations the private sector has made towards the Corona Virus Response.\n\nExpedite Payment of outstanding VAT refunds: The Uganda Revenue Authority will speed up payment of outstanding VAT refunds due to businesses accompanied by measures to limit fraud. An additional Ushs 120.53 billion will be refunded.\n\nFinancial Sector Stability\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to ensure financial sector stability in support of the economy, I reiterate the Bank of Uganda pronouncements on measures being implemented to mitigate risks to overall economic growth, and also ultimately support the financing of businesses:-\n\nProviding for adequate capital buffers for supervised financial institutions to ensure effective operation by deferring payments of all discretionary dividends and bonus payments for at least 90 days effective March 24, 2020. This preserves the capital of a financial institution and is intended to support the real economy;\n\nSmoothening out volatility in the foreign exchange market arising from global financial markets;\n\nProviding exceptional liquidity assistance for a period of up to one year to Supervised Financial Institutions that may need it;\n\nWaiving limitations on restructuring of credit facilities. Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs) have been permitted to restructure loans and provide loan repayment holidays to companies and individuals affected by the Corona Virus pandemic; and\n\nEncouraging the reduction of Mobile Money and other digital Transactions fees that are charged by Mobile Network Operators and commercial banks, in order to limit the use of cash and customer visits to banks.\n\nEnhance economic infrastructure\n\nMadam Speaker, economic infrastructure covering roads, rail, water, irrigation and air transport remains key to economic recovery and boosting economic transformation. The interventions that will be implemented to enhance economic infrastructure include the following:-\n\nUndertaking emergency maintenance across the country of Roads and Bridges infrastructure following the destruction caused by floods;\n\nDeveloping warehousing capacity at community, district and regional hubs across the country to restoring supply chains and promote exports;\n\nExpediting construction of priority industrial parks and special economic zones;\n\nRehabilitating the Meter Gauge Railway, improving water transport safety by installing navigation aids and development of air cargo infrastructure, including the completion of the new cargo facility at the Entebbe International Airport; and\n\nExpanding feeder and national road network, power, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure.\n\nImproving Peace, Security and Good Governance\n\nMadam Speaker, Government will continue to improve peace and security, the rule of law and good governance. As we have done before, good governance will be enhanced to provide the necessary conducive environment to facilitate all aspects of societal development. The specific measures address (i) the promotion of peace and security at the community and national level; (ii) enhancing effectiveness in public service delivery; and (iii) increasing access to justice.\n\nPeace and Security\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to promote peace and security of persons and property at the community level, we will implement the following measures:\n\nIntensify community vigilance by strengthening the Local Council system, promote community policing in coordination with Local Defence Units (LDUs);\n\nComplete the rollout of the Safe City CCTV project in Jinja, Lugazi, Kayunga, Njeru, Gulu and Masaka and ensure its effective utilization in monitoring crime and responding to distress calls;\n\nImprove border control through phased implementation of border point automation, in order to control illegal entry, improve compliance with immigration laws and regulations, and ensure national security;\n\nstrengthen the capacity of internal security; and\n\nFast track implementation of the convict transitional policy to integrate former convicts back into their communities.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to ensure the defence of the country, Government will further strengthen the capability of the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces, and enhance the effectiveness of the Intelligence apparatus.\n\nAccess to Justice\n\nMadam Speaker, to improve access to Justice, the following interventions will be undertaken:-\n\nConstruct an additional 5 one-stop Justice Law and Order Service Centres across the country;\n\nImplement the electronic case management system in the Judiciary to increase efficiency in case management;\n\nDe-concentrate services for Government Analytical laboratories and business registration services to regional centers in Arua, Fort Portal, Gulu, Mbale, Mbarara and Moroto;\n\nBuild capacity of Local Council courts in adjudication in order to decongest courts of petty cases and increase access to justice. To date 38,000 Local Council Court officials have been trained and a further 78,000 are targeted for training in 2020/21;and\n\nEliminate case backlog by implementing the case backlog reduction strategy, including the use of non-custodial sentences including Community Service to reduce remand population.\n\nMadam Speaker, Parliament recently enacted into law the Administration of the Judiciary Bill 2018 which comprehensively provides for the functioning, operation and administrative independence of the Judiciary. Construction of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal has commenced and will eventually address housing of these important appellant courts of law. We therefore look forward for enhanced performance of the Judiciary.\n\nPublic Service Delivery\n\nMadam Speaker, to achieve better public service delivery, the following actions will be undertaken: -\n\nIntegrate systems and implement one-stop Service Uganda centres to allow the public to access related services in a single location. The Service Uganda centres will be rolled out to 18 zonal offices across the country.\n\nDevelop the Public Investment Management Systems (PIMS) policy to strengthen Sector coordination in Project identification, preparation, implementation and ex-post evaluation; define roles and responsibilities of Project stakeholders, enhance project management and institute a culture of maintenance of public assets;\n\nImplement e-Government procurement across all Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Local Governments, and monitor government contracts and procurement in partnership with non-state actors in order to improve efficiency, eliminate corruption in procurement and reduce cost of doing business;\n\nEnhance tele-conferencing facilities in government to limit person to person contacts in addition to reducing on operational costs in terms of travel expenses; and\n\nFully implement the Leadership Code Act including the operationalization of the Leadership Code Tribunal to ensure that the Leadership Code of Conduct is effectively enforced among all Leaders and Public officers.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to address the challenge of corruption, the following measures will be undertaken:-\n\nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of oversight and anti-corruption institutions in identifying areas of risk;\n\nstrengthen implementation and follow-up on audit recommendations;\n\nstrengthen implementation of Public Finance Management rules and regulations and the role of Internal Audit; and\n\nenhance capacity of the Financial Intelligence Authority and related security agencies to intensify surveillance and gather of vital information to curb Anti-money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nFinancing Framework\n\nMadam Speaker, Government is developing an Integrated Financing Strategy to guide and monitor how we appropriately raise domestic revenues, and both domestic and external debt financing over the NDP III period. This strategy lays out how Government shall approprately raise financing to meet its development goals, in both the short and medium term. It will also ensure that Government only borrows at most favourable financing terms for projects that will provide a socio-economic growth dividend.\n\nMadam Speaker, the with respect to the Financing Framework that underpins the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy I have elaborated, it specifically balances the need to restore economic activity, on the one hand, while raising adequate revenues to finance government expenditures. The sources for funding include domestic revenues and public debt financing.\n\nDomestic Revenues\n\nMadam Speaker, domestic revenue measures for next financial year are anchored on the Domestic Revenue Mobilization Strategy (DRMS), which aims to mobilise sufficient revenue to support infrastructure development and social welfare. The Strategy balances competing challenges of increasing the revenue effort to support expenditure needs, while at the same time facilitating investment and industrialisation. The Strategy seeks to enhance revenue collection to finance the larger part of our Budget in the short, medium and long term and to create a tax system that is fair and transparent.\n\nMadam Speaker, in view of the recent emergencies we have faced, Government introduced modest adjustments in some taxes to raise revenue. This will support enhanced economic recovery, as well as maintain an acceptable level of social welfare. Tax administration will be strengthened to improve efficiency in revenue collection. The capacity of local governments, including the roll out of the digital collection of fees and rates, will also be enhanced to improve local revenue generation.\n\nMadam Speaker, next financial year&#39;s revenue target is UGX 21,810 billion, comprised of tax revenue amounting to UGX 20,219 billion and non-tax revenue of UGX 1,591 billion. This target translates into a revenue effort of 14.3 percent of GDP. To achieve this target, we will implement the following new interventions: -\n\nFurther roll out use of digital tax stamps and expand the range of products covered in order to deter under-declaration of production and importation. Digital stamps also ensure that goods on the market meet the required health and safety standards;\n\nWiden the scope of the income tax withholding agents across all sectors in order to broaden the tax base;\n\nEnhance rental income tax collection and compliance by implementing a digital collection solution, as well as gazette rental income tax chargeable in different geographical areas for taxpayers who do not voluntarily declare their rental income;\n\nGazette VAT withholding agents with an applicable VAT rate of 6 percent, and provide for penalties for failure to withhold; and\n\nRollout the use of Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs), which are - cash registers interconnected to the Uganda Revenue Authority, to improve record keeping and tax compliance.\n\nMadam Speaker, the modest adjustments to tax rates that have been made include the excise duty rate on fuel; and adjustments to improve competitiveness in the region, support compliance, remove ambiguities in the legislations as well as close loopholes that may lead to revenue leakage. In order to promote import substitution and the development of local industries, we have increased import duties on goods that are produced or can be produced locally. The import duty on agricultural products has been increased to 60 percent and other products to 35 percent.\n\nHitherto, we have been importing refined industrial sugar yet we are a surplus producer of sugar. We have agreed with sugar manufacturers to produce refined industrial sugar locally and we shall protect them from imports.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to support agriculture, VAT on the supply of agricultural equipment will be exempted. The supply of processed milk will also be VAT exempt to enhance the price competitiveness of milk produced in Uganda. In order to respond effectively to the covid-19 pandemic, taxes on supplies for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and management of the epidemics, pandemics and health hazards, will be exempt from customs duties.\n\nPublic Debt Financing\n\nMadam Speaker, total public debt as at December 2019 amounted to United States Dollars 13.3 Billion, with external debt accounting for United States Dollars 8.59 Billion or 64.4 percent while domestic debt amounted to United States Dollars 4.74 Billion or 35.6 percent of total debt stock.\n\nMadam Speaker, Government’s approach to public debt financing is elaborated in the Medium Term Debt Strategy for the five- year period commencing next financial year. The Strategy seeks to contract only affordable external debt in preference to domestic debt. The approach to reduce domestic debt in preference to external debt is intended to lower the cost of interest payments to 2.2 percent of GDP compared to 2.6 percent of GDP, if we were to continue borrowing signficantly from domestic sources.\n\nMadam Speaker, to ensure that public debt remains sustainable, we will implement the Domestic Revenue Mobilization Strategy to increase Government’s capacity to finance programs with less reliance on domestic and external borrowing. In response to the Corona Virus crisis, Government has commenced negotiations with some creditors for debt relief. This will free resources to finance interventions in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nResource Envelope and Allocations for Financial Year 2020/21\n\nMadam Speaker, the Resource Envelope of Financial year 2020/21 totals Shs.45,493.7 Billion of which Domestic Resources amount to Shs. 25,585.6 Billion. Domestic Financing amounts to Shs 3,560.3 Billion; while External Financing consists of Project Support of Shs. 9,515.3 Billion and General Budget Support Shs. 2,906.7 Billion. Domestic re-financing amounts to Shs. 7,486.1 Billion and Appropriation in Aid is Shs. 215.6 Billion.\n\nMadam Speaker, total Expenditure amounts to UShs. 37,792 Billion of which Recurrent Expenditure is UShs. 19,787.8 billion and Development Expenditure is UShs. 18,004.2 Billion. Sector allocations can be found in the Budget as approved by Parliament.\n\nConclusion\n\nMadam Speaker, Uganda’s economic outlook is positive. The Corona Virus pandemic has helped us to once again demonstrate the economic capacity and the vast opportunities that our country has. The budget for Financial Year 2020/21 will support the economy to fully recover, harness the potential that we have, and get back to our progressive journey of double digit GDP growth rate.\n\nThe focus of the budget for next financial year places emphasis on supporting livelihoods and the recovery of business enterprises, without losing focus on our long-term development initiatives. To this end, the Government will support the private sector to scale up production, sustain and increase employment.\n\nI call upon Ugandans to ensure they keep safe by particularly following the directives from His Excellency the President and Ministry of Health regarding CoVID-19. The challenge of CoVID-19 will go, and the economy will pick up once again even at a much higher speed. I therefore implore all Ugandans to be part of this journey and, in the end, enjoy the fruits of our common efforts.\n\nMadam Speaker, the recent emergencies, especially the Corona Virus pandemic have necessitated additional interventions and resource allocations after the Budget was approved. We have since been undertaking extensive consultations with several stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on remedial actions. Consequently, the budgets of all Ministries, Agencies and Local Governments will be revised to align them with the nine (9) strategic priorities and 14 production lines articulated by His Excellency, the President. This will focus the budget on production and not consumption. I will accordingly return to Parliament for the necessary approval.\n\nI beg to submit.\n\nFor God and My Country.&#34;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;A police officer has been ordered by the High court to pay Shs 50 million as part of the total Shs 282 million compensation awarded to Adrine Kemirembe after police illegally auctioned off her missing car.\n\nJustice Lydia Mugambe awarded Kemirembe Shs 120m for loss of income and Shs 150m in general damages - all to be paid by the government, and another Shs 50m to be paid Anatoli Muleterwa, then community liaison officer at the central police station (CPS) Kampala or be committed to prison.\n\nIt all started on November 14, 2008, when a Nissan Datsun pickup, registration number; UAE 130H belonging to Kemirembe went missing from Makerere University main library parking lot. At the time the car went missing, it was being driven by Kemirembe\&#39;s husband, Alex Ssebagala who was working on his dissertation at the university library.\n\nOn the same day, Ssebagala reported a case of a missing vehicle; SD REF 28/14/1108 at Makerere University police post and at Kampala central police station under reference No. ERU/999/CPSSD REF 15/29/12/0.\n\nThere was no report from the police about the progress of the search. But as fate would have it, two years later, court heard that on April 26, 2010, while in Kisenyi a Kampala a suburb, Kemirembe\&#39;s husband saw the missing vehicle used for business. Ssebagala then hired the vehicle up to Makerere University police station where the driver and turnboy were arrested.\n\nUpon interrogation, the driver, Jamil Mutyaba told police that the car belonged to Muleterwa, who was then the community liaison officer for Kampala Metropolitan Area. Court heard that the vehicle had been sold to Muleterwa\&#39;s wife, Margaret Kizza at Shs 1 million through auction. When confronted, Muleterwa asked Kemirembe to pay back the Shs 1 million that his wife paid for the car.\n\nMuleterwa, nowthe head of community policing department, told the court that the auctioning was legal since there was a court order, authorizing the auction after the custodian of exhibits at central police station complained that they were congesting the police station.\n\nHead of community policing department, ACP Anatoli Muleterwa at his desk recently\n\nHowever, in her judgement, justice Mugambe said that she failed to understand under what circumstances a missing car that had been reported to police, was auctioned and how it had reached the central police station.\n\n&#34;Needless to say, the close relationship of wife and husband between DW1 [Muleterwa] and Kizza Margaret who bought the car demonstrates a conflict of interest in DW1’s dealings in relation to this car...However more striking is the contradiction of DW1’s [Muleterwa] testimony when I look at the list of items the court authorized sale of and the list of items the auctioneer DW2 put up for sale. The plaintiff’s car is not listed in the court list – Exhibit D Exh1 but it’s listed in the auctioneers’ list for sale- annexture Dexh2.&#34; Mugambe wrote in her judgement.\n\nThe lady justice said there is no satisfactory explanation why or how Kemirembe\&#39;s car illegally got listed on the auctioneer’s list that led to its illegal sale when it was not authorized by court in its order of December 17, 2009. The judge said it was clear and easy to infer that Muleterwa\&#39;s hand was behind the grand scheme to illegally sell off Kemirembe\&#39;s car.\n\n&#34;It\&#39;s near to blasphemy that Muleterwa could stand in court on oath before me and insist that the sale of the plaintiff\&#39;s car was authorized by court whereas not. If he would lie in this aspect, one wonders which part of his testimony is truthful&#34;, Mugambe added.\n\nThe judge further said that Muleterwa was fully aware of the search operation for the lost car at the material time, yet he grossly involved in its misappropriation when it was sold to his wife illegally.\n\nKemirembe had calculated loss of income at Shs 50,000 per day for six days - translating to Shs 157 million but Mugambe reduced this to Shs 120m, saying the car couldn’t have been bringing full daily income for all the six days of every week and through the years. She said some days would be unprofitable and it would have worn off and the days of earning income would have reduced through the years.\n\nCourt also awarded Kemirembe Shs 12m in recovery as the total value for her vehicle. The total Shs 282m compensation will draw the interest of 15% pa from the date of the suit until paid in full.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Court has directed Monica Komujuni, the former manager of Kenyan firm Hass Scientific and Medical Supplies Limited to refund $42,000 (about Shs 156m) for illegally donating a haematology analyzer to Naguru hospital.\n\nIn her judgment delivered on Wednesday, justice Lydia Mugambe noted that Komujuni donated the machine, which counts and identifies blood cells at a high speed and accuracy without authorisation from the company leadership.\n\nDuring the hearing, Komujuni previously told court that the company had sanctioned the donation through its general manager, Stephen Ndegwa. She explained that Ndegwa sanctioned the donation as part of the company\&#39;s social corporate responsibility and an effort to gain business from government over their rivals Medishell, which had already donated another medical equipment.\n\nHowever, the company denied sanctioning the donation, saying it was only discovered while scrutinising the company documents following Komujuni’s resignation. They also discovered that Komujuni had registered another employee Cedrick Akwesigye as a contact person in case the hospital needed any technical information about the machine.\n\n“It is clearly demonstrated that the defendant donated the X1000 to Naguru hospital without the required authorization from the head office in Nairobi. There was also no knowledge at the head office, where decisions are made, that the said machine was donated by the defendant in the Kampala office,&#34; Mugambe wrote in her judgment.\n\nShe noted that the only authorization was for the donation of a smaller machine, which never left the office in Kampala. She said by doing this, the two employees acted in breach of trust and treachery when they went ahead to create a similar company Micro-Haem Scientifics and Medical Supplies Ltd dealing in the same business as their previous company.\n\n“Literally they stole the business of the plaintiff and acquired sole distributorship of the product the plaintiff dealt in in Uganda and then left the plaintiff company,&#34; the lady justice wrote.&#39;,

The video and messaging app available to download from the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Amazon App Store.\n\nMessenger Kids is designed for children from the age 6 to 12 years and controlled by parents who have the ability to control the people of who their kids can talk to, as well as supervise their children’s friending where they choose to allow their children to add, approve, or remove contacts.\n\nFacebook has worked closely with youth advisors team that is made up of experts in online safety, child development and media to shape the Messenger Kids app. Ahead of the launch, the social media giant also consulted with child safety advocates and educators across Africa to ensure that its providing a service that balances parental control with features that help kids learn how to connect responsibly online.\n\nFacebook has done this in response to the rising cases of Child-cyber insecurity especially in the covid-19 pandemic lock-down where nearly half of the world is online for all activities including online schooling.\n\nWhile kids use Messenger Kids, parents can connect with them using their Messenger app. Approved adults can easily message and video chat with their kids via the Messenger app — no additional app download is needed.\n\nOnce their account is set up by a parent, kids can start a one-on-one or group video chat. The home screen shows them at a glance who they are connected to, and when those contacts are online. Some fun features available in the app, include: playful masks, emojis and sound effects bring conversations to life, a library of kid-appropriate and specially chosen GIFs, frames, stickers, masks and drawing tools to let them decorate content and express their personalities, to mention a few.\n\nOn the other hand, through the Parent’s Dashboard, parents can control and monitor their child’s activity enabling them to:&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;We have reported many time that in this era, we can’t live or do without internet it is part of human necessity and — there’s no doubt to that. Even the United Nations (UN) declared that it considers internet to be a human right. Specifically, an addition was made to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore, everyone has the right to access internet.\n\nThe right to internet access is the view that all people must be able to access the internet in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom of expression &amp; opinion, and other fundamental human rights. It is therefore made available and affordable to all persons without discrimination. To access it, you need a plan which is offered by your internet service provider (ISP) such as; MTN, Airtel, Africell, Roko Telkom, Smart, Tangerine.\n\nInternet today costs as low as UGX250 and expensive as UGX550,000. While buying internet, one considers price &amp; volume given the most, and other factors such as; speed, ISP. The volume of data is as well considered as a key factor. We published an article published showing mobile data comparison between MTN, Airtel, and Africell, and found out that Africell gives more data for less compared to its competition.\n\nHowever, cheap internet gets, not everyone can afford it. Not taking that more as issue, there are many ways of accessing the internet without speeding a penny. This can be through free Wi-Fi, office internet, ask a friend to buy you, among others. And what we are going to look at in this article, is ‘Internet Sharing’.\n\nIn this article, we show you how to share internet on MTN. MTN has an internet share plan just like Airtel’s Tugabane. MTN Internet Share is a service that enables MTN customers to buy and share internet bundles with up to five other MTN customers. MTN has the Me2U option as one of the ways to share internet however, it is different in that here you share by sending some of your data to the recipient. For instance, if you have 2000MBs you can share 500MBs which isn’t possible with Internet Share.\n\nGetting started with MTN Internet Share and How to Share\n\nBoth persons should be MTN users and their mobile numbers are valid.\n\nDial *150*70# &gt;&gt; select option one to choose between the three bundles they offer; 10GB at UGX50,000, 20GB at UGX20,000 and 30GB at UGX500,000. These offers are valid for 24 hours. Re-dial *150*7# and select option 2 to add up to 5 MTN users to share internet with. Use options 3 and 4 to see who you’ve added and who to remove respectively.\n\nIt is possible to set usage limits for the different numbers activated to manage the bundle swiftly. In most cases, there will be that team member that doesn’t need as much as the rest. Consequently, you can assign more volume to the members that certainly need it and fewer to those that use more Wi-Fi than Mobile Internet. Setting limits helps you prevent the users from exhausting your data quickly because they only use what has been assigned to them.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;The government of Uganda through the Ministry of Finance on Thursday 11th, May 2020 passed the FY2020/21 National Budget reading, revealing the ICT and National Guidance sector gets 0.36% (UGX162.9 billion) of the UGX45.5 trillion. The budget was delivered to members of parliament by the Minister of Finance; Hon. Matia Kasaija and to the H.E. President Yoweri Museveni who followed and delivered his speech and remarks digitally from State House in Entebbe.\n\nThis financial year budget for the sector gets an increment from UGX146.2 billion (0.36% of UGX40 trillion) of the FY2019/20 budget. The money will be used perhaps by the sector to complete some of its tasks and pledges such as; continuous extension of the NBI Network to districts, departments and agencies, creating more fibre optic network links, among others. These pledges the sector looks at working on were revealed last month during the NRM manifesto week — a week where Ministries come out to showcase the sector’s achievements over the last four years.\n\nSome of the pledges the sector looks at working on include but not limited to;\n\nDeveloping an ICT innovation framework, which will, among others, guide on innovation areas, funding opportunities and innovation partners, clients and innovation resources. Supporting existing hubs through training, affordable bandwidth, mentoring and innovation infrastructure. A mentoring and coaching centre for SMEs will be established for quality assurance. This measure will also be complimented with support to SMEs certification and standardization of local products. Targeting areas for innovation and linking them up with private sector innovators, with a view of developing viable solutions for commercialization. Establishing multi-purpose ICT parks which will attract both foreign and domestic entrepreneurs. Establishing ICT innovation Centres of Excellence. Creating and implementing appropriate incentive schemes for BPO operators and IT innovators. Furthermore, we will market Uganda’s BPOs to the external market.\n\nThe President further gave directives to the sector clearly spelling out specific interventions in achieving the set out plans before end of 2021. Thereby, the money allocated to the sector will be much of use. His directives included;\n\nStoping the criminally irresponsible and biased reporting by media houses. Propagating the use of electronics in Uganda and supervise the mastering of this technology. Encouraging the assembling of computers in Uganda and do away with importing already assembled computers ─ old or new. Eventually, to build our own computers and mobile devices. Accelerating the roll-out of ICT-based community centers.\n\nThe ICT and National Guidance has with no doubt have its services have perform well over the period.\n\nDuring the State of Nation Address delivered by the President early this month, said that the ICT sector is one of the country’s real economy — employing 1,282,818 persons with 380,896 companies engaged in information technology, telecommunications, broadcasting, postal and courier and audio-visual.\n\nThe Minister of ICT and National Guidance; Hon. Judith Nabakooba during the NRM Manifesto Week announced some of the achievements the sector has accomplished, among which include;\n\nA total of about 4,000KMs of fiber optic cable has been laid. 480 government Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) and local government (LGs) have been connected to the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI). Over USD$200 million (roughly UGX757.9 billion) has been generated from commercialization on the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) in the last five years. 31 police stations and 9 UPDF sites have been connected to the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI). Free Wi-Fi connectivity, MyUG is provided to the general public in 284 locations in the Kampala and Entebbe from 5PM to 6AM. The National Broadband Policy 2018 was approved. 17 regulations developed under the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC) Act 2013. The National data centre and disaster recovery site have been upgraded to the Tier 3 classification hosting 60 MDAs, over 90 critical applications and 358 websites. The National strategy on the fourth industrial revolution has been developed to guide the country in the adoption of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and 5G. Government Citizens Interaction Centre (GCIC) has been strengthen to provide social media communication on government programmes.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other the Science, Technology and Innovation received 0.58% (UGX264.5 billion) of the budget. In this sector, core projects have, too progressed well: the Machining Manufacturing and Industrial Skills Training Centre (MMISTC) at Namanve was commissioned in January 2020. The centre will provide industrial skills training and apprenticeship, and manufacture high quality precision machine parts and accessories.\n\nThe first phase of the construction of the Kiira Vehicle Plant at the Jinja Industrial Park is 50% complete, and two Kayoola Electric Buses have since been developed, assembled and tested under a technology transfer project with China High-Tech Corporation.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;MASINDI – Members of the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs visited Masindi High Court on a fact-finding exercise.\n\nThe legislators who were led by Hon. Robina Rwakoojjo Gureme, were on Wednesday, June 10 received by the Masindi Resident Judge, Gadenya Paul Wolimbwa.\n\nThey said they wanted to know the workload at the circuit, establish the level of case backlog as well as assess the mechanism and methods that the Court is using to address case backlog.\n\nThese, equally wanted to inspect the infrastructure for delivery of justice, determine the efficacy of Plea Bargain and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) programmes in addressing case backlog and determine the extent to which the courts are implementing the Gender and Equity Strategy.\n\nOther members on the team included Hon. Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda, Hon. Gaster Mugoya, Hon. Mathias Mpuuga and Hon. Agaba Abbas Mugisha.\n\nJustice Gadenya, who was accompanied by Mr Kintu Simon Zirintusa, the Assistant Registrar; Mr. Kule Moses Lubangula, Chief Magistrate; Ms. Aber Irene, Magistrate Grade I; and other staff from the circuit, led the Judiciary team that interacted with the MPs.\n\nHe said the Circuit as at May 30, had completed 977 cases in the current financial year and that 2,163 cases, were pending. He added that out of the pending cases, 1,516 were backlogged.\n\nJustice Gadenya then took the MPs through some of the interventions that the circuit has put in place to reduce backlog that now stands at 70 per cent, which include holding civil and criminal sessions, intensifying the use of Plea Bargain, weeding out unmeritorious cases by both the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts and effectively management of cases.\n\nSome of the issues raised by the MPs included how the Court was using ADR to reduce case backlog. In response, the Assistant Registrar explained that he does most of the ADR sessions assisted by a religious leader from Hoima resulting in a completion of 128 cases in the same period.\n\nThe legislators advised that given the plurality of our society, it is important for the Court to involve religious leaders from different faith and civic leaders representing the different interests in society in ADR to avoid complaints of bias and to raise confidence in the process.\n\nThey also recommended training of mediators both within and without the legal sector to increase the capacity of the court in dealing with cases outside the traditional mechanism of adjudication, which is time consuming, slow and costly.\n\nThe Judiciary was urged to operationalise the Registry of Mediation and give its own staff to concentrate on ADR, instead of relying on judicial officers who are over burdened with adjudication and over worked.\n\nOn the Chain Linked Programme, the MPs wanted to know how the court and the Office of the DPP were working together to reduce criminal case backlog, particularly in weeding out unmeritorious cases and speeding up trials.\n\nThey were informed that the Masindi Chain Linked Programme was last year recognised by JLOS as the best performing DCC in the country.\n\nThe MPs were informed that because of the Chain Linked Programme, the Masindi Chief Magistrates’ Court has only 75 backlogged criminal cases.\n\nOn reducing case backlog, the lawmakers recommended that the jurisdiction of Magistrates should be enhanced to relieve the High Court of some cases.\n\nIt was proposed that the jurisdiction of the Chief Magistrate should be increased from Shs50 million to Shs200 million to suit the current economic realities.\n\nThe Judicial Officers were advised to prepare cases adequately before going to court since early and efficient preparation of cases is essential to the timely disposal of cases.\n\nOn improving the terms and conditions of service for administrative staff , the MPs said they were going to petition the Ministry of Public Service to improve salaries of administrative staff to match the enhanced salaries of judicial officers.\n\nOn addressing gender equality, they advised the Judiciary to use the electronic media to sensitize the public about the evils of gender based violence and inequality in society.\n\nAs a means of ensuring self-sustenance and growth, judicial officers were advised to engage in economic activities instead of only waiting for salary and enhanced retirement benefits. It was noted that expanding the economic wellbeing of judicial officers would reduce incidents of corruption in the administration of justice.\n\nThe Resident Judge thanked the legislators for finding time to interact with the Judiciary at the grassroots where justice matters matter most to the common person.\n\nComments&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;MENGO – Just days after meeting Uganda Premier League clubs, the Federation of Uganda Football Associations (FUFA) held another consultative meeting on Friday, June 12.\n\nThe meeting which was also held at FUFA House in Mengo, was with teams playing in the FUFA Big League.\n\nThe meeting chaired by FUFA President Moses Magogo in the presence of some FUFA Executive Committee members hinged on three key salient issues that included; how best clubs can brand themselves to suit modern trends, club licensing activity calendar and the proposed FUFA Competitions reforms.\n\nProposed action plan for FUFA Big League Club Licensing\n\n-FUFA Consultative meeting with clubs – 12th June, 2020\n\n-Release of Club licensing regulations – 22nd June, 2020\n\n-Clubs express interest to participate in the 2020/2021 season – 23rd– 26th June, 2020\n\n-First phase of the Clubs Pro Agenda – 1st– 10th July 2020\n\n-Submit Clubs’ License application and all supporting documents – 13th– 24th July 2020\n\n-First review and decision by First Instance Body-FIB (Club Licensing Committee) – 27th -29th July 2020\n\n-First inspection of clubs’ facilities – 6th -13th August 2020\n\n-End submission and uploading of Players’ documents on FIFA Connect System&amp; Domestic Transfer Matching System (DTMS) – 14th August 2020\n\n-Second review and decision by First Instance Body-FIB (Club Licensing Committee) – 17th August 2020\n\n-Second Inspection of facilities – 4th September 2020\n\n-Final decision by appeals body – 7th -11th September 2020\n\n-Release of final list of successful clubs – 14th September 2020\n\n-Release of fixtures -29th September 2020\n\n-Kick-off of 2020/2021 FUFA Big League – 29th October 2020\n\nWhat they said\n\nMoses Magogo, FUFA President\n\n“I take this opportunity to thank everyone that has attended this meeting. We appreciate your efforts towards developing the game of football. This meeting is aimed at evaluating ourselves, see how far we have moved but also know where we are going. For long we have dwelled on the sporting ground but we should be thinking about the other elements like governance and looking at the business side of football.\n\n“As football, we have failed to realize the potential we have and how best we can tap into sponsorship monies. There are very many teams in the FUFA Big League that can embrace the community sense of belonging because you have huge but dormant fan bases. We need to play the game of numbers because a sponsor doesn’t look at how you spend but rather the value you give. The brand of the Big League is as strong as the clubs and that is what we must do and that is why we insist that instead of giving you the fish, we should give you the net to get more fish.\n\n“We hope that the situation gets better and have these games played. As FUFA, we want promotion to be on sporting grounds and that is why we are still buying more time. However, this will depend on the guidelines given by the Ministry of Health.”\n\nFUFA 1st Vice President, Justus Mugisha.\n\n“When we brought the Juniors League in 2015, majority of the clubs in the Uganda Premier League saw it as a burden but for some who put emphasis on their teams have benefited. For instance, look at KCCA FC, they have been promoting players from their Junior team into the senior team and yet maintaining their standards in competing for titles.”\n\nKataka FC Vice chairman, Hassan Kakaire Kirunda\n\n“I thank FUFA for the interaction we have had today, it has been fruitful and I propose that going forward, we should have such meeting often’ said Kirunda whose proposal was welcomed and an agreement was reached to have quarterly meetings between FUFA and the clubs’ management top brass.”\n\nPaul Mark Kayongo, Chairman of Ndejje University FC\n\n“I thank FUFA for the meeting. I believe it was a good gesture in boosting stakeholders’ confidence. What I request is for FUFA to make emphasis on the principles and revisit the existing FUFA Big League guidelines and see how teams can improve.”\n\nGilbert Nyaika, Kitara FC\n\n“For the time I have been at Kitara FC, I think this is the first meeting we have had with FUFA at this level. It is important that FUFA gets to know our challenges as clubs and definitely such meetings are going to help.”\n\nFUFA 2nd Vice President, Darius Mugoye\n\n“I’m happy to report that I have observed the FUFA Big League for some time and I can say there is more football than politicking. If only clubs can employ the right human resource, then development and growth of clubs will be realized.”\n\nFUFA Club Licensing Chairman, Rogers Mulindwa\n\n“Club licensing is the kitchen of football across the world. Governance, financial stability and standards are very key. We need to move together with owners, leaders and technical staff to develop the game. The action plan is well laid out and ready to start.”\n\nOn the proposed FUFA Competitions reforms, in particular the playing format, members made various contributions on the matter but were later given an opportunity for further extensive discussion and report back on the agreed position.\n\nEach of the 16 teams playing in the FUFA Big League will have a Junior League team, playing in the regional league where the particular team is based.\n\nThe aforementioned reforms are supposed to come into effect for the 2021/2022 season with next season (2020/2021) acting as a transition period.\n\nComments&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;KAMPALA — President Museveni has made changes at Kampala Capital City Authority’s (KCCA)— appointing Ms. Dorothy Kisaka as a substantive executive director.\n\nMs. Kisaka the governance advisor in the office of the Prime Minister has replaced Andrew Mubiru Kitaka who served for 1 and half years in acting capacity.\n\nThe President has appointed four more directors including deputy KCCA executive director Eng. David Luyimbazi Saali who has replaced Samuel Sserunkuma.\n\n“I’m writing to request you to interview for me the following persons and find out whether they are suitable to kan the indicated offices in Kampala Capital City Authority,” the president wrote in a letter to public service commission.\n\nAccording to KCCA’s employment records, Mr Kitaka is a substantive director of engineering and technical services.\n\nMr Kitaka was picked on December 20 2018 by the former Kampala minister Beti Kamya as the safe pair of hands to replace Ms. Jennifer Musisi who had resigned the same job.\n\nHowever officials at KCCA and Public Service Commission have previously queried his tenure as acting executive director, saying that his continued stay in office in acting capacity raises audit queries.\n\nThe KCCA executive director, deputy executive director and directors are appointed by the President on recommendation of the Public Service Commission.\n\nPresident Museveni Yoweri on Thursday June pointed out that he is not happy with Uganda’s tax to GDP ratio of 14.3%.\n\nHe said both KCCA and URA were not doing enough to collect taxes.\n\nHe said the low tax collection was due to massive corruption by Uganda Revenue Authority officials that he has since forced out.\n\n“There has been a lot of corruption in URA. That one I have cleaned. We have cleaned that crowd of the corrupt. Like we shall do in other areas,” he vowed.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has also appointed Dr. Daniel Okello Ayen, as Director, Public Health and Environment, Ms. Sarah Kanyike, for Director Gender, Community Services and Ms. Grace Akullo, for Director, Human Resources and Administration.\n\nThe said that “we have used integrity hunting to identify the persons mentioned above.\n\nWith regard to all the other vacant position at KCCA, the president has directed that they should be filled by advertising, utilising Public Service systems.\n\nComments&#39;,

He said like security, they can’t afford to continue looking on as people’s lives continue to be threatened.\n\nEnanga said their engagement with the leaders of the traders is to see that the situation is reversed peacefully. He, however, says that if they fail to get an amicable settlement, then they will be forced to crack the whip.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic in Uganda, cases were imported into the country either by people returning from abroad or by the across the border truck drivers.\n\nThe new trajectory of the virus has started to worry the policy leaders to the extent that while launching the distribution of face masks early this week, Dr Ruth Aceng said they might think of recommending the reinstatement of the lockdown.\n\nComments&#39;,

Things got to a head when his wife Denise was airlifted to Nairobi with Covid-19. Pierre himself was admitted internally at the weekend with Covid-19. He died on Monday with the government delaying the announcement to prepare how to deliver the terrible news. Heart attack was found more convenient as a cause,” a commentator wrote, hours after his death was announced.\n\nLike Tanzania, Burundi adopted a dismissive approach in her response to the Coronavirus pandemic and even went ahead to organise the country’s scheduled elections on May 20, where Mr. Nkurunziza’s successor Evariste Ndayishimiye was chosen as other neigbhours locked down.\n\nOn May12, Burundi under President Nkurunziza announced expulsion of the country’s top World Health Organization (WHO) representative and three other experts coordinating the coronavirus response saying the four officials were “persona non grata” after they reportedly questioned the transparency in the approach of the government.\n\nThose expelled included Dr. Walter Kazadi Mulombo, then Burundi’s coronavirus coordinator Dr. Jean Pierre Mulunda Nkata, communicable diseases head, Dr. Ruhana Mirindi Bisimwa, and a laboratory expert in the testing for COVID-19, Prof. Daniel Tarzy.\n\nDiplomatic and administrative sources quoted by AFP then indicated that the foreign ministry aborted a similar attempt to expel the same four officials a month earlier.\n\nAccording to sources in Bujumbura, Mr. Nkurunziza has become the biggest victim of what they called the “country’s shabby response to the Coronavirus pandemic and failure to listen to the WHO expertise” in advancing measures to combat it’s spread in Burundi, with his close family members hospitalised in various facilities.\n\n=================================\n\nHave your say in our comments section\n\nComments&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Love-hate: The story of the boda boda cannot be told enough, and with the government refusing to release them for us, we cannot just sit back and pretend not to miss them; that sweet lugambo, the haggling and what not.\n\nOur memories of Kampala would be incomplete without boda bodas. There would be nothing for us to stand for – nothing, just blank passages in our books of Uganda. We have all interfaced with boda bodas in different ways, we love to hate them, but we also hate that we love them. For all the good and the bad, boda bodas remind us of ourselves, our shortcomings, and yet despite our flaws, there is good that comes out of us.\n\nWe sang about boda bodas. It could be Maurice Kirya or even the woman who has been the subject of different lyrics. Don’t you all remember Zuena and her musical stint? What would life for Najjera peeps, aka Najjerians, be without boda bodas? We all know these Subaru drivers keep asking their girls to use boda bodas and they will refund on arrival. If Subaru drivers did not have cars, they would make good boda boda riders. In fact, it is rumoured that many of them are former boda boda users.\n\nYet, boda bodas teach many of us how to drive. The recklessness of boda bodas forces all these road users to pay extra attention. A boda boda could come out of anywhere. They are like ghosts. There is no better school of defensive driving than this city where boda bodas define our life.\n\nWe cannot forget the ‘bibozibozi’ of boda boda riders. These guys will have a say about everything. Sometimes you just want to sit quietly, on the journey but boda riders will not allow it. The best of conversations happen on these boda bodas. The riders will assure you of the wonders they have done out of the business. Of how they now own shops kumasitoowa in Nansana. Before long, they turn to you for therapy. They will seek advice about their relationships. Boda boda riders claim to know everything about everyone. You are passing some house and they assure you how the resident is a ‘big fellow’ in government. That he is the one who advises Museveni on everything.\n\nWho does not enjoy the haggling process? That moment when you flag down the boda rider and seek their services. Do you notice that the riders will charge you based on your ‘masappe’? Lawyers have suffered with the haggling process. Given that most of them are in ties and suits, boda riders never spare them the high prices. You then see them haggling in sign language before flagging down the bike. They will show the sign of a fist to assure the boda boda that all they have is 5K.\n\nBoda bodas will never accept that sometimes they have no idea about a place or a certain location. You can ask the boda boda to take you to ‘George Floyd’ and he will reply; “tuula, nkuminya.” They will keep riding until such a point when they are like: “Boss, mpozi which place?” Then he will start seeking directions from other boda riders. Ugandans are eager to give directions, but they also do a poor job giving them. Finally, it will all end with a humble confession: “Boss, George Floyd is where?”\n\nIt is also rumoured that the big threat to Kampala marriage is boda riders. Whereas Ugandan lawyers and bankers suffer from cash flow problems, it is not an issue for boda riders. The boda man will always have something for his wife every day. Mbu they are available, emotionally and physically. They will not claim how it is not yet payday. For bodas, every hour is pay hour. But the boda riders also know one thing that most men don’t, that’s the art and science of giving compliments.\n\nA boda rider will notice things even a lady has never noticed about herself. They will praise every strand of hair on her head. They will whistle: “Bambi Beyonce, come I take you.” These compliments are a rarity in most relationships. Ugandan men need to learn from Luo men. Some lady said the way Luo men say the word ‘baby’, you can feel one’s ovaries twerking. But hey, do not make a mistake to flag down a boda when in the presence of a pretty lady. They will charge you to the neck. They will strike the spear right into a man’s ego.\n\nWe all know that with this traffic jam in Kampala, there is only one solution – boda bodas. If not for Boda bodas, some of us would have missed flights, job interviews, dates, sure wins from Makindye girls, even funerals. Because of boda bodas, our life has gotten better, not worse. The accidents could be the humble price we pay for the efficiencies of boda bodas. How would some women know about their co-wives if not for the gossip channels of boda bodas?\n\nWe hope sooner than later, we can restore our hate and love relationship with boda bodas. We hope we can get back to those adventurous night outs as bodas drop us home and both parties fear each other. We hope we can get back to the moments when bodas dent our cars yet claim to be the ones in the right?\n\nBoda bodas may be a burden, but it is a burden we want to carry. At such a time when we do not need this burden any longer, our pockets shall speak. #Bodabodalivesmatter\n\nTwitter: ortegatalks&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;James Onen alias Fat Boy is one of the longest serving radio personalities in Uganda given his 21-year stint on the airwaves in Uganda.\n\nThe 44-year-old was last Wednesday fired from Sanyu FM alongside several other presenters for allegedly absconding from work.\n\nHe was hosted on KFM Friday morning where he denied claims of absconding from work.\n\nAccording to him, none of the radio employees, owned by property mogul, Sudhir Ruparelia, had absconded from work before the sacking.\n\nHe said a day before he was fired, he received a phone call from his head of department asking him not report for work until management sorted out some issues with the proprietor.\n\n“We were called back by management and next thing were emails that we had been fired. Management is trying to get ahead of the story with lies that we rejected a pay cut. That is not true. We accepted a cut; though it was not in writing. We understood Covid-19 had affected everyone and had agreed to work with that,” he said.\n\nFat Boy says despite receiving many phone calls from several lawyers asking to represent him in court to institute a case against the radio managers, he is taking each day as it is. He said he will first talk to his other colleagues on the way forward.\n\nFat Boy who had been presenting two shows at the station vowed never to return to the station, if offered another opportunity, because of the way he was treated.\n\n“I have been loyal to the station for the past 21 years. I didn’t deserve to be laid off like that. I was treated like trash,” he said.\n\nHe, however, believes that his sacking might have been a blessing in disguise because he will be able to weigh his options.\n\nFat Boy breaks down what happened and what next? Is it the end of the 20 year radio career? #DMightyBreakfast#SuperstarFriday https://t.co/ZzbdvjMfJP — 933 KFM (@933kfm) June 12, 2020\n\nissejjombwe@ug.nationmedia.com&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;“Harry Potter” author JK Rowling revealed on Wednesday she is a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault.\n\nThe celebrated British writer said in a blog post that she was disclosing the information to give context to her controversial past comments about transgender women.\n\n“This isn’t an easy piece to write,” Rowling said in a 3,695-word essay on gender identity and her own troubled past.\n\n“I’ve been in the public eye now for over twenty years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor,” Rowling wrote.\n\n“This isn’t because I’m ashamed those things happened to me, but because they’re traumatic to revisit and remember.”\n\nRowling caused a scandal by tweeting last weekend about “people who menstruate”.\n\n“I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?”\n\nThe tweet forced “Harry Potter” star Daniel Radcliffe to apologise to trans women who may have been offended by Rowling’s remark.\n\n“Transgender women are women,” Radcliffe wrote in a post for The Trevor Project website.\n\nThe feud dated back to comments from December in which Rowling expressed support for a woman who had lost her job over what her employer deemed to be “transphobic” tweets.\n\nRowling said on Wednesday that “accusations and threats from trans activists have been bubbling in my Twitter timeline” ever since.\n\n“Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by the trans activists; I know this because so many have got in touch with me to tell their stories,” she wrote.\n\nRowling ended her post by affirming that she was “a survivor (and) certainly not a victim”.\n\n“I haven’t written this essay in the hope that anybody will get out a violin for me, not even a teeny-weeny one,” she said.\n\n“I’ve only mentioned my past because, like every other human being on this planet, I have a complex backstory, which shapes my fears, my interests and my opinions.”\n\n‘Mentally sexless’\n\nRowling said she had spent many years thinking about trans issues because of her own troubles with gender identity when she was young.\n\n“When I read about the theory of gender identity, I remember how mentally sexless I felt in youth,” she wrote.\n\n“As I didn’t have a realistic possibility of becoming a man back in the 1980s, it had to be books and music that got me through both my mental health issues and the sexualised scrutiny and judgement that sets so many girls to war against their bodies in their teens.”\n\nThe 54-year-old said she spent a period feeling “ambivalence about being a woman” before learning that “it’s OK to feel confused, dark, both sexual and non-sexual, unsure of what or who you are”.\n\nShe also argued that “the current explosion of trans activism” has resulted in too many people undergoing gender reassignment surgery without giving it sufficient thought.\n\n“I want to be very clear here: I know transition will be a solution for some gender dysphoric people, although I’m also aware through extensive research that studies have consistently shown that between 60-90 percent of gender dysphoric teens will grow out of their dysphoria,” she said.\n\n“So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make… girls and women less safe.”\n\nBut she also stood up for her right to speak freely about an issue that she said has been with her throughout life.\n\n“As a much-banned author, I’m interested in freedom of speech and have publicly defended it, even unto Donald Trump,” she wrote.\n\nRowling’s books have been banned in parts of the world because of their association in some cultures with witchcraft and the occult.&#39;,

He was also the host of the Saturday morning Alive and Kicking radio show.\n\nOn a Facebook post, Fatboy praised his fans and promised to communicate his next plans.\n\n“21 years. The ride is over. Thanks for the support all these years, you’re the best fans in the world. Will communicate future plans soon. In the meantime, ladies, I’m coming for some transport money. #SavetheBoyChild,” he posted.\n\nFat Boy has been one of the biggest hosts on Sanyu FM. He has been known for his controversial style on radio. During the 21 years, he worked with other well-known presenters like Crystal Newman and Seanice Kacungira. While they left over time, FatBoy remained, till now.\n\nHe has been replaced by popular comedian Patrick Idiringi commonly known as Salvado.\n\nRumour is rife that the employees have sacked for holding a strike over a salary reduction. The Twitter timeline for the radio station, @882SanyuFM carried messages asking for a lawyer to provide services for people who the tweet said had been wrongfully dismissed.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Patrick Salvado Idringi once worked for Capital FM but left radio due to his busy schedule among other reasons. This was during a time when his comedy career was skyrocketing. Now that it’s there, he has decided to return to the airwaves, this time at the oldest radio station in Uganda, Sanyu FM.\n\nSalvado made the announcement on his social media captioning the poster. “Well well. Tomorrow it’s a date 6-10am the breakfast show Sanyu FM”.\n\nWe immediately contacted him to tell us what made him change his mind about re-joining radio and he said this was supposed to have happened earlier on.\n\n“I was supposed to have come back last year but I didn’t get a show I wanted on my former station. Then I was contacted last week about joining Sanyu and they were giving me the biggest show so I couldn’t say no,” he told us.\n\nAs one of the biggest comedy exports we have, it is hard to see how Salvado will sustain his radio job when things get back to normal because of his busy schedule but he’s not worried about that for now: “Well I can’t tell the future for sure but right now I want to focus on making whatever show I get the best listened to show in the country,” he said.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Ugandan musician Bebe Cool was on Tuesday trolled on social media after he posted questioning Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza’s cause of death.\n\nThe government of Burundi said Tuesday that Nkurunziza, 55, died of heart failure, just months before he was to step down after 15 turbulent years at the head of the troubled nation.\n\nHowever, several people have been speculating and questioning government account on his death given the fact that his wife, first lady Denise Bucumi, is currently recovering from the coronavirus in a Nairobi hospital after being evacuated late last month.\n\nThe Wakayima singer, real name Moses Ssali on Tuesday posted saying amateur politics was self-poison, reason he supports President Museveni.\n\n“Amateur politics is self-poison and that’s why I support president M7,as in when you eat a frog,always eat a fat one. How does a man with such physical fitness health wise die of a heart attack? Am just a musician and what do I know? Anyway Just asking, putting the wife’s condition of being flown to Nairobi for Corona virus treatment aside, do Kenyans have the cure for covid-19?????? Rip president Nkurunziza,” Bebe Cool posted on his social media platforms.\n\nHowever, the post attracted angry comments from some of his followers, most of whom reminded him of the footballers who have died on the pitch.\n\nOne such follower was Sebiranda Najib who said, “But I remember I have ever seen a footballer who fainted in the playground and died instantly. Should we say he was also poisoned! Sometimes I sit at my home and ask myself ‘ is Bebe Cool the problem oba the problem is Bebe Cool.”\n\n“Plz ur just a musician ? thx for identifying yourself. Today you’ve proved to Museveni that he always puts u in wrong position of politics ,” Hustler Petter replied.\n\nUmaisha Mousa replied saying, “In my opinion, I think people should be sensitized about the huge difference between Cardiac arrest n Heart attack ? Whether you’re gyming 24/7 the truth is heart attack can’t spare!! Heart attacks are mostly triggered by excessive stress n uncontrolled anxiety ?? as long as your body is overwhelmed by uncontrolled stress, heart attack can’t spare you even if you’re physically fit!!”\n\nHowever, Joe Elunya Snr was concerned that Bebe Cool’s account could have been hacked.\n\n“Someone hacked Bebe’s account this can’t be him,” he said.“Talk about it!!! But according to the insiders,the guy was infected with Corona….he deliberately refused to seek for help while the wife and kids were flown to Agha Khan hospital in Nairobi for treatment,” Pretty Sharon replied to Bebe Cool’s post.\n\nNkurunziza first began to feel unwell after attending a volleyball match on Saturday, and appeared to be improving until he took a turn for the worse on Monday and his heart stopped, the presidency said in a statement.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;The death of Maj Gen (Rtd) Kasirye Ggwanga yesterday drew eulogies from friends, musicians, politicians and top military officers, among others.\n\nMaj Gen Ggwanga, 68, died a month after being admitted to Nakasero Hospital in Kampala following an illness which the army said they were still waiting for the medical report to ascertain.\n\nSome of the notable musicians who eulogized the man with wealthy descriptions, among which included arrogant, proud, loose talker, down to earth, straightforward, brave and cantankerous, among others are singers like Bobi Wine, Bebe Cool and Catherine Kusasira.\n\nIn his eulogy, Bebe Cool described the retired major general as “a true hero” before adding that he will be missed.\n\n“A true hero departing on HERO’S day. Rest in peace Major General K.G. You will be missed,” Bebe Cool posted on his social media platforms.\n\nKusasira only said, “Hero, Heroic!! Rest in Eternity Gen Kasirye Gwanga.”\n\nIn his eulogy, Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine said he had an opportunity of being Ggwanga’s personal friend over a long time.\n\n“I had the opportunity of being his personal friend over a long time. We agreed and disagreed on many things, but every time I met him, there was a lot to learn. Like many prominent people in this country, Gen. Kasirye’s arrest, detention and eventual death is shrouded in mystery. Like many Ugandans, I am hoping that those in authority will provide satisfactory answers. May his soul rest in peace,” Bobi Wine posted on his social media platforms.\n\nIn January last year, there was drama at Makindye, a Kampala suburb when Ggwanga shot at a car belonging to Kusasira.\n\nPolice said the shooting followed a quarrel between Maj Gen Ggwanga’s children and the National Resistance Movement leaning artiste’s aides over noise pollution.\n\nPolice later said it was stuck with the case after Kusasira declined to record a statement.\n\nIn March this year, the retired senior military officer stunned the entertainment industry when he said he did not know Bebe Cool, real name Moses Ssali.\n\n“I don’t know Bebe Cool, who is he? I only hear that he is an artist but I’ve never seen him physically or held his hands. I know Chameleone and I’ve told you that he is my friend but Bebe Cool, what is so special about him? Of what importance or how can he even help NRM? To tell us about the Ghetto? You’re so stupid. Why did you grow up in the Ghetto? You ran away from home and you ended up growing up in the Ghetto,” said Maj Gen Ggwanga who carried himself with such an independent mind that political correctness had no borderline on his tongue.\n\nIn response, Bebe Cool wrote,” “Sir, retired major general Kasirye Gwanga, you have my full respect and you will always have it despite the fact that you disrespect me, a person you have never met or interacted with.”\n\nMaj Gen Ggwanga saw himself only as a hero. Ggwanga’s words often elicited as much joy as they did anger. Many times, even those who took offence silently smiled at his frankness. His was a life of sweet arrogance.\n\nLt Col Deo Akiiki, the Deputy UPDF spokesperson, told journalists that they agreed with the deceased’s family on a tentative programme to bury him on Friday in Mityana District.\n\n“There will be no vigils both in Kampala and in the village. We shall allow selected UPDF officers and family members to attend the burial,” he said.\n\nLt Col Akiiki also said Maj Gen Kasirye will be buried with military honours.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;“Gone with the Wind” was removed from the HBO Max streaming platform Tuesday, as mass protests against racism and police brutality prompt television networks to reassess their offerings.\n\nThe multiple Oscar-winning US Civil War epic released in 1939 remains the highest-grossing movie of all time adjusted for inflation, but its depiction of contented slaves and heroic slaveholders has garnered criticism.\n\n“‘Gone With The Wind’ is a product of its time and depicts some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that have, unfortunately, been commonplace in American society,” an HBO Max spokesperson said in a statement to AFP.\n\n“These racist depictions were wrong then and are wrong today, and we felt that to keep this title up without an explanation and a denouncement of those depictions would be irresponsible.”\n\nDemonstrations have swept the United States since the May 25 killing of African American George Floyd while in police custody, with calls growing for police reform and the broader removal of symbols of a racist legacy, including monuments to the slave-holding Confederacy.\n\nFloyd died last month as a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck for almost nine minutes. The officer has been charged with second-degree murder.\n\n“12 Years A Slave” writer John Ridley said in a Los Angeles Times op-ed Monday that “Gone with the Wind” must be removed as it “doesn’t just ‘fall short’ with regard to representation” but ignores the horrors of slavery and perpetuates “some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color.”\n\nThe film will return to the recently launched streaming platform at a later date, along with a discussion of its historical context, the company said.\n\nNo edits will be made, “because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.”\n\n“If we are to create a more just, equitable and inclusive future, we must first acknowledge and understand our history.”\n\n‘Normalized injustice’\n\nMeanwhile Tuesday, long-running reality series “Cops” was canceled by Paramount Network.\n\nThe show followed real-life US officers on duty for over three decades, but had been accused of glamorizing aspects of policing and distorting issues such as race.\n\n“‘Cops’ is not on the Paramount Network and we don’t have any current or future plans for it to return,” a network spokesperson told US media Tuesday.\n\nPolice shows — both reality and scripted — are among the most-watched on US television but have come under scrutiny.\n\nCivil rights group Color of Change, which campaigned against the show for its depiction of suspects and alleged masking of racism in police forces, welcomed the news Tuesday.\n\n“For 30 years, #COPS has normalized injustice and misrepresented crime, policing and race,” tweeted president Rashad Robinson.\n\n“But it’s far from the only crime TV show to do so.”\n\nDan Taberski, whose podcast “Running from Cops” claimed the show allowed police to remove unflattering material during editing, said he was “hopeful its cancellation 31 years later is a sign of positive change to come.”\n\nPopular reality cop show “Live PD” has also been removed from schedules, while Jessica Alba-starring scripted procedural “LA’s Finest” saw its season premiere delayed Monday.\n\nAnd in the UK, the BBC said it had pulled sketch show “Little Britain” — which features scenes where white actors wear makeup to portray characters from other ethnic backgrounds — from its iPlayer streaming service.\n\n“Times have changed since Little Britain first aired so it is not currently available on BBC iPlayer,” a spokesperson for the national broadcaster said Tuesday.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;A Redditor has posted a simple way of watching YouTube videos in a web browser without any ads. In most cases those who want to do away with these constant YouTube Ads is by paying for YouTube Premium. But there is a simple hack around this now.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nALSO READ: Getting started with YouTube Music and YouTube Premium for Uganda, Nigeria, and Kenyan users\n\nIn the URL for whatever video you want to view, you just need to add an extra period after the dot com in the YouTube link. This means this method will not work in the YouTube app.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis works as described for me when pasting a video URL into an incognito browser window with the added period. In addition to removing pre-roll ads, it also eliminates mid-roll interruptions for videos as well. By the time you’ve copied, pasted, and altered the video URL, I’m not sure how much time you’re really saving over just waiting for the “skip ad” button to appear — but it does indeed work.\n\nAs for why something so trivial is successfully getting around YouTube’s advertising machine, here’s what Redditor unicorn4sale said when posting the trick:\n\nStay Updated\n\n“It’s a commonly forgotten edge case, websites forget to normalize the hostname, the content is still served, but there’s no hostname match on the browser so no cookies and broken CORS – and lots of bigger sites use a different domain to serve ads/media with a whitelist that doesn’t contain the extra dot”\n\nThe hack has received over 4,000 upvotes on Reddit, it’s likely that YouTube already knows people have caught wind of this loophole. The oversight is probably going be corrected sooner rather than later.\n\nOutside of that, remember that ad revenue partially helps your favorite creators keep doing what they do. Ad blockers and this trick take away those resources. The “proper” way of no longer seeing ads is to subscribe to YouTube Premium, which you might already know since the YouTube app relentlessly badgers people about it with maddening frequency.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Multichoice is bringing popular Subscription Video-On-Demand (SVOD) services of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video to its DSTV Explora decoders. This comes after the DSTV owner signed deals with respective parent companies of the aforementioned services.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe same was referenced in Multichoice’s annual results for the year ended 31st March 2020, where Multichoice is quoted to have admitted to going through with the deals to improve its customer retention strategy. This comes after the onslaught of Netflix, that’s making DSTV Premium shed customers in favor of online SVOD service as faster connectivity becomes widely available.\n\nThe quoted statement reads Signed deals with Netflix and Amazon to integrate service onto new Explora decoder.\n\nDSTV Explora decoders are famed for their ”advanced” features that include internet connectivity, PVR functionality and Multichoice already offers its DSTV Catch up, movie rental service Box Office and recently Showmax on the decoder. To this list, it now adds foes like Netflix &amp; Amazon Prime Video that directly compete with its Showmax service.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRelated: How To Connect Your DSTV Explora Decoder to Your Home Internet\n\nThe statement further goes on to state that Netflix &amp; Amazon Prime Video will be added to Multichoice’s upcoming Explora decoder but this puts to question whether the same will be headed to the current Explora decoders in the market.\n\nStay Updated\n\nMuch as these services are destined for the Explora Decoder, Multichoice last year made itself clear that it will launch its standalone DSTV Streaming service to better compete, with reports suggesting it will morph from its DSTV Now Service. The service is said to be in testing phases as of this writing.\n\nThe only limitation with DSTV Now is it’s tied to one’s DSTV subscription to work so people without an active DSTV subscription are left out. The Standalone streaming service is meant to mitigate this.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;As more and more businesses convert to working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many have resorted to using Zoom. Guzmo is an African made video conferencing web application — the first of its kind to be made in Africa.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nGumzo, which means “chatting” in Swahili, it is free for attendees to use with no time-limits, giving unlimited call duration and unlimited callers in a meeting. For those who want to host calls, you will have to pay $1 per week and can enjoy a one-week free unlimited trial. The downside here is that at the moment they only support MPESA as a payment method for your subscription. After sign up, you won’t need to download anything else to use Gumzo.\n\nThe Kenyan developers who made this app took eight weeks to make the first African-made video conferencing system. Gumzo – which is Swahili for “chatting” was made in the offices of Usiku Games, a Nairobi company that until a few months ago, focused on making video games for the African market.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nREAD MORE: The Rise and Rise of Zoom during the pandemic\n\nTo join a chat room, you’ll need the room URL just like Google meet and its equivalent to a Zoom ID. The URL can be shared by the chat room host. Before you join the call, you’ll be prompted to register via an SMS verification and create your profile i.e. name, avatar, and username.\n\nStay Updated\n\nGumzo runs entirely on your browser allowing it to run with minimal requirement. However, for you to have a smooth experience, your computer must meet these minimum requirements;\n\nHave an up-to-date and supported browser like Chrome, Safari or Firefox Have an up-to-date operating system like MacOS Mojave or Windows 10 Have a stable internet connection.\n\nWhen it comes to privacy, the Guzmo creators say that their chat channels are entirely private. They have a strict system that will ensure their client’s personal information and contact details are private. Their calls are encrypted end-to-end with no back-doors, so your private chat is yours. The company admits that they require more user validation than some of their competitors, but that helps to keep their clients safe, but closes the door on people who create false accounts just to create trouble.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;MultiChoice has signed a huge streaming deal with Netflix and Amazon to bring these streaming international streaming services to its own unified platform.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe news was unveiled in the company’s annual results presentation for the year ended 31 March 2020. They will be entering into a streaming deal with both Netflix and Amazon to add both services into its upcoming Explora device. The service will be piloted in South Africa initially but it will spread to the rest of Africa later on in the year.\n\nThis means DStv customers who own the Explora decoder model will be able to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime Video if they wish to subscribe to them.\n\nMultichoice will need to position the business for the future, leverage the group’s scale, and enhance the product ecosystem by providing access to a wider variety of content, the group recently concluded distribution agreements with two major international Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) providers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn addition to this deal, MultiChoice provided more information regarding its upcoming DStv Now standalone streaming service.\n\nALSO READ: DSTV Now set to be a standalone service like Netflix in 2020\n\nIn order to get onto the popular streaming bandwagon, Multichoice decided to sign distribution agreements with two major international subscription video-on-demand services. They couldn’t reveal much since they are still in a pre-release embargo period with both of these international players. So they couldn’t go into the specifics until the formal consumer release.\n\nSo what happens to ShowMax?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe company has however promised to share more information in the next few weeks, which will include details on how consumers will interface and engage with content from these streaming services. They also confirm that the agreement formed part of a new unified streaming platform MultiChoice would launch that would include content from international players.\n\nEach of the different service providers has very specific content that sits on their platform, and ShowMax content typically doesn’t overlap that much with these other content providers. So the company is trying to is to provide an amount of simplicity, choice, and convenience to subscribers – they can come to one place and can get access to all of this different content.\n\nThe move by Multichoice is no different from the broadcast content aggregation they have has been doing for years – this time it is just done via an over-the-top (OTT) streaming platform.\n\nWhere does this leave DStv Now?\n\nWith over 19.5 million subscribers, it is no surprise that these large international streaming platforms were attracted to partner with MultiChoice and DStv.\n\nPenetrating the African market is not as easy as it seems for these streaming services, especially given our low internet penetration numbers. It seems Multichoice is confident and the agreement with DStv makes a lot of sense to them, too.\n\nAccording to the financials released in January this year, Netflix has over 52 million from the Africa, MiddleEast, Europe, and Asia (AMEA) region. It also reported stronger-than-expected financials, with revenue of $5.47 billion and earnings per share of $1.30, compared to analyst estimates of $5.45 billion and EPS of 53 cents.\n\nALSO READ: Netflix enters 2020 with 52 million paid subscribers in AMEA region\n\nBut how will all these affect DStv Now? The company will still offer DStv Now. It is not going to go away any time soon, but alongside that, they promised that it has a more slick and more developed component of linear television that represents itself in the streaming product. This means customers will decide for themselves how they want to watch.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Imagine an underground metro railway system in a city like Kampala–okay that’s enough to stop imagining. This was the first thought that popped into my mind when I saw Kampala City Council Authority’s (KCCA) new public transport route that taxi and bus operators started using with effect from 4th June after H.E the President announced that they will resume operations after weeks of lockdown. The multi-colored straight lines on the map can give an illusion of a future high tech transportation system that Kampala dwellers can only dream of. One would only wish we had such an underground railway system in Kampala.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMy first underground travel experience was in Paris 2012, I was amazed at how the system works. The Paris Metro opened on 19 July 1900, and the subway has grown gradually, inaugurating the last line in 1998. This line is considered one of the most modern worldwide. Currently, Paris Metro has 303 lines and is 136 miles (219 km) long. It’s so organized in such a way that passengers can use the same travel card and the difference between the underground and train is barely noticeable.\n\nA functioning mass transit system is most important to back up mobility in large cities and conglomerations. Many other countries like the USA, UK, Singapore, China, etc have a similar transportation system due to the high people and vehicle traffic in those cities.\n\nAn Underground Metro System\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSuch a system will reduce on the traffic jam, reduce unnecessary road accidents, and provide cheap transportation (if subsidized by the government) among the various merits that come with a metro subway system.\n\nUnderstanding the new Public transportation Routes\n\nNow back to our reality, KCCA’s new public transport route is well thought of and squeaky clean– having well-demarcated routes with bus stop numbers to clearly guide passengers and drivers to their destination. Kampala’s day population is about 5 million and 2 million by night. This implies that about 3 million people come in and out of the city on a daily basis.\n\nAccording to the new arrangement, the Central Business District (CDB) lines A, B, C F, H, I, M, N P, Q, S, U, and Y will operate in the Old Taxi Park while taxis operating on Line C, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, and S will operate from the New Taxi Park. Usafi taxi park will have taxis operating on lines N, P, R, S, and U while Kisenyi taxi park will have Lines P and S. The V lines will operate from the Natete park while the X lines are reserved for metropolitan bus services only. See below\n\nCentral Business District (CDB) taxi routes\n\nLet’s give an example, If you are going to Nansana you have two route options; one can use taxis operating on line L2 from the Central Business District (CDB) via Bakuli, Nakulabye to Wakiso or H4 from the CDB via Makerere and Kasubi. All the routes are well organized but will take a bit of a steep learning curve for passengers to know where to get which taxi to take them to their final destinations. It also ensures drivers know their routes of operation and drive only in those routes as registered with KCCA.\n\nThe taxi operators are required to pay the mandatory fees for a PSV license, have a renewal of driving permit if expired and third party insurance. They also had to pay other government fees by 31st Dec 2020 giving them a grace period of six (6) months. The six months grace period which expires 31st Dec 2020 is to allow public transport operators to obtain a permanent route chart, color code for GKMA, and other user fees. Effective 1st January 2021, all vehicles that would have not complied shall not be permitted to operate in the GKMA.\n\n\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWe recommend KCCA to make an app for the detailed route map to ease life of the passengers.\n\nThe Detailed Map\n\nKampala Transportation Routes (Metro)\n\nPossible challenges of a Metro in Kampala\n\nHowever much I would love our beautiful city surrounded by seven hills to have a great underground metro system to ease transportation and cut on the traffic jam situation above the ground, our government is not ready to embark on such a complex project. As Ugandans, we seem to prioritize on the now and forget and not the fur future. Other experts have argued that making Kampala a futuristic city is close to impossible now. We would be better off with a whole new city, but if you would insist on Kampala, we would opt for an overground or hybrid metro-system like in Dubai.\n\nWe would face several challenges as a country if we were to embark on such a huge project. This includes; funding, corruption, engineering construction challenges, unstable power system, environmental impact, underground noise or air pollution, natural hazards, the establishment of laws and regulations for safety risk management, and underground metro robberies. The list is endless.\n\nLet’s also consider Metro subway station fires that often have serious consequences because of the high density of people and a limited number of exits in a relatively enclosed space. The urgent demands for land resources in urban development, more and more underground spaces, such as subway metro stations, underground malls, parking lots, water, Optic fiber cable and so on, are explored and constructed. Due to the compact structure, high population density, limited number of exits, and other factors, serious consequences can be induced by disasters in subway stations, which have become a great public concern.\n\nALSO READ: Full specifications of the Kayoola EVS™ Buses that have hit the streets of Kampala\n\nBoda bodas still play a crucial role\n\nLet’s not forget our boda boda friends. The Boda Bodas play a critical role in transporting a good number of people in the city but they need to be regulated to enhance the safety of the public. We know that the government is in the process of finalizing the extent of a boda boda Freezone and the gazetting of boda boda stages in the City. According to KCCA, future Boda boda operations will also be subjected to Standard Operating Procedures. Gazetting of stages and their return to the city will be communicated in due course.\n\nIn conclusion, as a developing nation all this is just a dream, but still in the grasp of our future generations. This requires governments that have long term plans to predict and the zeal to implement futuristic transportation in Kampala or how any new city will look like in the next 50 years. What do you think about Kampala having a Metro system? Leave us a comment below.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Sites that carry the most traffic in the world like Google, YouTube, Facebook are already known to us all. But did you know that this is just a drop in the ocean on the internet? There are many websites that are very popular but are hidden away and you cannot find them by searching your popular search engines. That space is where the Dark Web and the Deep Web exist.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo understand the Dark Web or Darknet, we need to first attempt to define it more. Its is composed of many websites on an encrypted network with hidden IP addresses – all of which gives users strong anonymity protection. In simple terms, no one can see what you are doing while you are there.\n\nWhen one opens up a website, they strive to ensure that the site is indexed by search engines like Google, Bing or Yandex, but for the dark web, you can only access them with special anonymity browsers, which include Freenet, I2P, and The Onion Router also known as TOR browser.\n\nDark Web Vs Deep Web\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThese two are always confused. The Deep Web is all the sites on the web that can’t be reached with a search engine. Although this includes sites on the Dark Web, it also includes sites that serve more mundane functions, such as business intranets, webmail platforms, databases, online banking platforms, and services that usually require a password or other means of authentication.\n\nThese are found and accessed directly with a URL or IP address and are hidden behind firewalls, paywalls, and HTML forms. Because all these other pages are included in the Deep Web, the Deep Web is actually far more vast than the regular internet (also known as the Clear Web).\n\nIs it illegal?\n\nUsers of the Dark Web are assured of full anonymity but this also yields a great breeding ground for illegal activities. They use this space to buy or sell illegal goods such as stolen data, unprescribed drugs, or dangerous weapons.\n\nThe Dark Web can also be used for legitimate reasons. We have seen whistleblowers, activists, journalists, and others who need to share sensitive information, especially on political figures. This has made it popular as a lot in exposing information that would have not been known to the public for fear of political persecution or retribution by their government or other powerful actors.\n\nIn some countries, security and intelligence agencies also use it to monitor terror groups and track cybercriminals. In what may come as a surprise to many, corporate IT departments frequently crawl the Dark Web in search of stolen data and compromised accounts, and individuals may use it to look for signs of identity theft.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOne of the most defining era of the Dark web was during the times of WikiLeaks – the website that publishes classified official materials – which also has a home on the Dark Web. Big companies like Facebook also maintain some form of presence there in order to make itself accessible in countries where it is censored by the government.\n\nGood things you can do on the Dark web\n\nExpose abuses of power Buy restricted good Exchange information in countries with internet censorship Simply use the internet anonymously Buy legal goods anonymously\n\nHow to safely access the Dark web\n\nThere are many ways to access the Dark web, but the most popular one is Tor browser. It used a highly secured network of volunteer relays around the world through which users’ internet connections pass through.\n\nYou will need to download and install the Tor browser bundle. Tor URLs end in the domain.onion and not domain.com. Website addresses here are not simple to memorize and they often change their URLs in order to evade detection and DDoS attacks.\n\nWhen you’re on the Dark Web, ISPs – and by extension, the government – might not be able to view your activity, but they will know you are on the Tor Network. This alone is enough to raise eyebrows in some countries.\n\nIt is very paramount that you access the Dark Web while using a VPN before going through the Tor Network. With this method, your ISP only sees the encrypted VPN traffic, and won’t know you’re on the Tor network.\n\nWe recommend you use a trusted VPN provider, one that doesn’t track your activities when you log on. Finally, always connect to your VPN first before opening the Tor browser.\n\nGet a trusted VPN provider and run it Download and install Tor browser bundle Look for the Tor Browser folder and click on the “Start Tor Browser” file inside it. Click on the “Connect” option to open the browser window. Start browsing.onion websites\n\nPrecautions and Safety\n\nIf you want to remain totally secure on the Dark Web, you should take the following extra security measures including:\n\nNever use your real name or photos\n\nNever use an email address or even a password that you have used before\n\nInstead, use an anonymous encrypted email account and aliases that you have never used before and that cannot be traced to you\n\nDisconnect from the internet before opening documents downloaded&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Paris, France | AFP | While lockdowns undoubtedly avoided large numbers of deaths from the new coronavirus, the repercussions of the pandemic response are expected to blight economies and health systems long after restrictions are lifted.\n\nSo how can we quantify the costs and benefits of one of the largest public health interventions ever?\n\n“This is a very difficult calculation to make,” Sarah Burgard, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, told AFP.\n\nAccording to official counts, the virus has infected at least 7.4 million people around the world and more than 415,000 have died.\n\nBurgard said in the end it may prove difficult to untangle how many deaths were caused by COVID-19 and how many by “the chaos and fallout” of the crisis.\n\n“I don’t have a lot of faith that we are going to be able to come up with a very clear number,” she said.\n\nEven if a figure is reached, decisions over its implications would be “heavily political and ethically complex”.\n\nThe response to the disease had led to an unprecedented reorganisation of societies, with businesses shuttered, stay-at-home orders, medical facilities refocused on treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe economic impact of the measures has caused alarm and division.\n\n– ‘Unknown situation’ –\n\nIn a study published in 2000, the American economist Christopher Ruhm asked a provocative question: “Are recessions good for your health?”\n\nHis research found that a rise in unemployment sharpened stresses on mental health, causing increases in substance abuse and suicide.\n\nBut there were unexpected benefits for physical health: road accidents and pollution reduced, while people had more time for exercise.\n\nReflecting on his work two decades later, Ruhm said that in a normal economic slump “when unemployment was high, mortality was low and vice versa”.\n\nBut the coronavirus-induced recession is not a normal economic downturn.\n\n“We are in an unknown situation,” Ruhm said in an April online talk for the University of Virginia, where he is a professor of public policy and economics.\n\n“I think it may be the first time in history that we are actually deliberately creating a recession, not because we want to create a recession, but because this health threat is so real.”\n\n– No silver linings –\n\nNow societies are bearing the strain of both a deadly pandemic and a huge economic shock.\n\nThe virus undercuts the usual “silver linings” of an economic downturn, said Burgard.\n\nPopulations have been confined inside, reducing access to beneficial physical exercise.\n\nPeople struggling with bereavement, mental health issues or unemployment find it harder to access their normal support networks, with even visits to family members restricted.\n\nAnd the healthcare sector itself has been battered by the virus, with frontline staff at risk of infection while treatments for other illnesses have been postponed.\n\nEven in normal times, any positive effects seen in economic downturns are often in richer nations.\n\n“The opposite seems true in many low- and middle-income countries, where mortality actually increases during recession,” said Thomas Hone, a public health researcher at Imperial College London.\n\nHe said this may suggest that what protects people from the harms of recessions are “strong health systems and social security nets”.\n\nMany fear the scale of the pandemic and economic downturn will disproportionately hurt the most vulnerable.\n\nUN agencies and the vaccine alliance Gavi have said virus restrictions caused immunisations to be disrupted in nearly 70 countries, affecting some 80 million children under the age of one and threatening a resurgence of preventable diseases like polio and measles.\n\nThe World Food Programme estimates the number of people facing acute hunger this year could nearly double — to 265 million.\n\n– ‘No choice’ –\n\nWill the long-term ramifications of lockdowns counteract the effect they had on slowing contagion?\n\nIn a study published on Monday, Imperial College researchers estimated that lockdowns had prevented around 3.1 million deaths in 11 European countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Imperial epidemiologist Neil Ferguson told a British parliamentary committee that because of the exponential spread of the virus, locking down just a week earlier would have reduced the final death toll by “at least a half”.\n\nBut any modelling is based on assumptions — in this case calculations of what would have happened if action had not been taken.\n\nRestrictions were imposed after predictions of potentially enormous tolls, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University.\n\n“I don’t think politicians and leaders had a choice,” he said.\n\n“If you saw those numbers in the millions of deaths, you had to take steps because you would have had a broken health system, a public that wouldn’t have come out anyway because they would have been terrified.”\n\nCaplan said there should be a “broad set of voices” in determining whether the lockdowns were the right solution, but added that the question would be “political”.\n\nAnd will the people whose lives are affected in the future be counted in this reckoning?\n\nSome think not.\n\n“We will not have the director general of health reeling off the statistics of excess mortality by suicide or stroke every evening,” French sociologist Didier Fassin said in the newspaper Le Monde.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;ICC must up its game to survive after US onslaught: experts\n\nThe Hague, Netherlands | AFP | The International Criminal Court must step up to ensure its survival after US President Donald Trump authorised sanctions against the tribunal over an Afghan war crimes probe, experts said Friday.\n\nTrump’s adminstration on Thursday unleashed an unprecedented onslaught against what it branded a “kangaroo court”, subjecting ICC officials to asset freezes and travel bans if they target US personnel.\n\nThe move escalates long-standing US opposition to The Hague-based court, which is battling its own poor track record of convictions, lack of support from the world’s largest powers and internal disputes over pay.\n\nBut analysts and rights groups urged the under-fire ICC — set up in 2002 to prosecute the world’s worst crimes — to continue its work with renewed vigour if it wants to cement its legitimacy.\n\n“I believe that the future of the court depends on its willingness to prosecute the ‘hard cases’ involving powerful countries like the United States, Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom,” William Schabas, international criminal law professor at Leiden University, told AFP.\n\n“For too long its work has been directed at developing countries and pariah states. Delivering equal justice for all means that it can tackle the strong as well as the weak.”\n\n– ‘Unprecedented’ measures –\n\nThe United States — like Russia, China, Israel, Syria and a number of other countries — is not a member of the ICC, and its opposition to the court is longstanding.\n\nIn 2002 the US Congress even passed the so-called “Hague Invasion Act” allowing the US president to authorise military force to free any US personnel held by the ICC — in theory making an invasion of Dutch shores a possibility.\n\nBut the Trump administration has now gone further, preemptively targeting the court over any attempt to prosecute US personnel over alleged war crimes in Afghanistan, or its ally Israel over the situation in the Palestinian territories.\n\nUS Attorney General Bill Barr said Thursday’s steps were just the first against a “corrupt” institution that he accused, without giving evidence, of being manipulated by Russia.\n\nPersonal sanctions by Washington are “unprecedented,” said Carsten Stahn, programme director at Leiden University’s Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies in The Hague.\n\n“They may complicate the investigations and seek to discredit not only individuals but the institution as such. It is thus important that other states speak up clearly to support the independence of the court,” Stahn told AFP.\n\nRights groups too have called on the ICC’s 123 member states to reaffirm its support for the tribunal, a court of last resort for war crimes and crimes against humanity if countries were unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects themselves.\n\n“It is now upon ICC member states to translate their statements of support into action,” said Amal Nassar, the International Federation for Human Rights’ representative at the ICC.\n\n“This includes full cooperation with the court in its investigations, adequate resources, and a clear signal that ICC staff, their families, human rights defenders and legal professionals can count on their support and protection,” Nassar said.\n\n– ‘Wave of solidarity’ –\n\nBut the virulent US opposition against the ICC might have a counter-productive effect, Stahn said.\n\n“Curiously, the US political attacks may backfire in the sense that they may create a new wave of solidarity at a time where the ICC is undergoing internal reform efforts,” he said.\n\nIts governing body, the Assembly of States Parties, in particular “is now asked more than ever to reaffirm the core principles of the ICC,” said Stahn.\n\nStahn however said he did not believe the sanctions would threaten the court’s existence.\n\nThe ICC has started a new set of prosecutions which included the surrender of Ali Kushayb, a Janjaweed militiaman accused of war crimes committed in Sudan’s Darfur region in 2003-2004.\n\n“In some situations, ICC investigations may also serve US interests,” he said.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;All set for Ndayishimiye to take charge in Burundi\n\nBurundi court orders president-elect sworn in after leader’s death\n\nBujumbura, , Burundi | AFP | Burundi’s constitutional court on Friday ruled that the country’s newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be rapidly sworn in following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\nNkurunziza’s death on Monday, aged 55, came after the May election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, as the constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\nHowever in its judgement the court wrote that an interim period “is not necessary”.\n\nThe court ruled that the country must “proceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye”.\n\nNkurunziza, a devout evangelical who believed he was chosen by God to lead Burundi, leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi, while a personality cult grew around Nkurunziza which saw the ruling party name him a “visionary” and “supreme guide for patriotism.”\n\nUnited Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.\n\nNkurunziza’s decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.\n\n– Handpicked successor –\n\nHis successor Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the ruling party’s core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent. Opposition claims of widespread fraud were dismissed by the constitutional court.\n\nWhile he is also a general, Ndayishimiye is not a regime hardliner and Nkurunziza was expected to continue to play a significant role, possibly limiting the independence of his successor who is reputed to be more tolerant and open.\n\n“In principle it is an opportunity for him to free himself, in the sense that we would have expected Nkurunziza to play an important role in the future,” said Richard Moncrieff, an expert with the International Crisis Group (ICG).\n\nHowever some observers have said he may run into trouble with the generals if he tries to introduce reforms or improve the human rights situation in the country.\n\nAfter the news of Nkurunziza’s death Ndayishimiye vowed to “continue his high-quality work that he has done for our country”.\n\nA source in the French presidency said the country would work with its European partners and “extend a hand to the new Burundian president”.\n\n“For the first time we will have a leader who is not just forging ahead regardless of the consequences, wrapped up in divine faith.”\n\n– Questions over death –\n\nThe government has yet to announce a date for Nkurunziza’s funeral, but is marking a seven-day period of national mourning, during which it has banned music in bars, nightclubs and karaoke, a statement said Thursday.\n\nBoth Kenya and Uganda on Friday announced they would be flying their flags at half-mast to honour Nkurunziza.\n\nThe Burundian president died of what the government said was a heart attack, however suspicion is high he may have had the new coronavirus.\n\nHis wife Denise Bucumi was hospitalised at the end of May with the virus. A medical document seen by AFP said she had tested positive for the virus and suffered “respiratory distress”.\n\nA medical source at the Karusi hospital where Nkurunziza died, told AFP he had also been in “respiratory distress” before his death.\n\nA medical source at the Kamenge university hospital in Bujumbura told AFP that the head of the institute of public health “came to requisition our hospital’s only ventilator and the head of our reanimation service in the name of the presidency on Monday at 10am”.\n\nBoth were flown to the hospital in Karusi, but it was “too late, president Nkurunziza was already dead,” a medical source in Karusi said.\n\nBurundi has largely ignored the virus outbreak, taking few measures to combat its spread compared to many of its neighbours which implemented strict lockdowns and curfews, and holding an election campaign.\n\nThe country has officially reported 94 cases and one death.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Moscow, Russia | AFP | President Vladimir Putin said Friday an “absolute majority” of Russians backed his controversial plan to change the constitution, as he made his first public appearance after weeks of lockdown.\n\nRussia, which has the world’s third-largest coronavirus caseload, this week lifted tight restrictions as Putin set the stage for a vote on July 1 that could extend his hold on power until 2036.\n\nPutin greeted his compatriots at an open-air flag-raising ceremony in western Moscow to mark Russia Day, a public holiday.\n\nHe was surrounded by allies, including prominent paediatrician Leonid Roshal.\n\nAppearing without a mask and smiling in the bright sunshine, the 67-year-old leader praised the spirit of the Russian people as well their traditions and culture.\n\nHe said it was only natural that Russians wanted to see these “fundamental, basic premises” reflected in the constitution.\n\n“I am sure that an absolute majority of our citizens share and support such a position,” Putin said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, he also bestowed labour awards on Roshal, popular Soviet-era actor Yury Solomin and other figures.\n\nPutin, who has dominated Russia for two decades, in January unleashed a political storm, proposing an overhaul of the constitution, the first changes to the basic law since 1993.\n\nIn a carefully-choreographed move, he later agreed for the amendments to include a provision that would reset the clock on his term limits to zero, meaning he could potentially stay in power until 2036.\n\nEven though infections have been declining in Russia, many doctors and Kremlin critics say the lockdown restrictions have been lifted prematurely in Moscow, the epicentre of the Russian outbreak.\n\nCritics accuse Putin of rushing to drum up support ahead of the vote as his approval ratings fall, according to independent pollsters.\n\nOn Friday evening, authorities will stage a concert on Red Square, adding however that those attending will respect social distancing rules.\n\nOn June 24, Putin will also preside over a massive military parade to mark Soviet victory in World War II.\n\nBoth the vote and the parade had to be rescheduled due to the lockdown.\n\nOver the past few weeks Putin has largely worked from his residence outside Moscow.\n\n– ‘Major risk’ –\n\nOn Friday, Russia reported 8,987 new coronavirus infections, taking the total to 511,423 cases.\n\nThe capital — Europe’s most populous city with more than 12 million residents — confirmed 1,714 new cases.\n\nOn Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin discouraged people from attending mass events.\n\n“This is a major risk for you, your children, and your loved ones,” he said in televised remarks.\n\nMoscow lifted restrictions including compulsory travel passes on Tuesday, a move welcomed by residents who rushed outdoors to enjoy the sunny weather.\n\nRussia has confirmed a total of 6,715 coronavirus deaths, a far lower mortality rate than in other countries with large outbreaks.\n\nCritics have cast doubt on those figures and accused authorities of under-reporting to play down the scale of the crisis.\n\nAfter the criticism Moscow health officials have adjusted how they report numbers.\n\nThis week, officials said the capital recorded its highest fatality count in a decade last month, with more than one-third of the deaths due to the new coronavirus.\n\nThe city’s health department said a total of 15,713 people had died in May.\n\nIt was the largest number of deaths since the summer of 2010 when Moscow was battered by an unprecedented heatwave and smog.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Top US general says wrong to appear with Trump at protest site\n\nWashington, United States | AFP | America’s top general said Thursday he was wrong to appear with President Donald Trump in a photo op near the White House last week, staged after the area was forcefully cleared of anti-racism protesters.\n\n“I should not have been there. My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of military involvement in domestic politics,” General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of the controversial June 1 incident.\n\nMilley’s comments appeared likely to further strain the already fraught relations between US military leaders and the White House.\n\nThey came two days before Trump will appear in person at the graduation ceremony of the elite US Military Academy at West Point.\n\nThe ceremony is being held despite the coronavirus pandemic at Trump’s own wish, and he often uses such events to lay claim to his bonds with the military and assert his role as commander-in-chief.\n\nBut relations have frayed over Trump’s move to involve the Pentagon in efforts to quell protests and some looting around the country following the killing of African-American George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer.\n\n– Battle uniform –\n\nMilley and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper were both strongly criticized for participating in what was widely seen as a political show by Trump, who walked with officials from the White House to pose in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, holding up a Bible.\n\nMinutes earlier, hundreds of peaceful protestors had been forced from Lafayette Park between the White House and the church by police and National Guard troops firing smoke bombs and tear gas-like pepper rounds.\n\nMilley’s presence was particularly criticized as he was wearing his camouflage battle uniform.\n\nNormally military officials wear their formal dress uniform when holding meetings in the White House, and for many it implied Milley’s support for Trump’s stated desire to deploy active duty US troops against protesters.\n\nIn a pre-recorded video message, Milley told new graduates of the National Defense University that pictures of him and Esper walking with Trump “sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society.”\n\nTrump had summoned Milley and Esper to the White House to discuss the extraordinary measure of using active military troops in addition to National Guards to confront protestors.\n\nPentagon officials have said both had little time to prepare for the meeting, which caught Milley in his battle uniform and Esper as they were headed to a separate non-public meeting.\n\nNor did they know ahead of time that National Guard troops were going to clear the park using chemical munitions to force the protestors out, Pentagon officials said.\n\nSeveral former holders of Milley’s position blasted him and Esper for accompanying Trump and allowing the military to be politicized.\n\n“I am deeply worried that as they execute their orders, the members of our military will be co-opted for political purposes,” said former Joint Chiefs chairman admiral Mike Mullen.\n\n– Freedom to protest –\n\nTwo days later Esper announced that he would not support Trump’s desire to invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to call up active troops to deal with the protests.\n\nThat, according to media reports, infuriated Trump, who had to be convinced by White House advisors and senior lawmakers not to fire Esper.\n\nIn his speech Thursday, Milley stressed that US citizens have the constitutional right to protest peacefully.\n\n“We should all be proud that the vast majority of protests have been peaceful. Peaceful protests mean that American freedom is working,” he said.\n\n“We in the military will continue to protect the rights and freedoms of all American people,” he added.\n\n– ‘Total confidence –\n\nTrump made no immediate comment on Milley’s statement, but it sparked speculation the president could retaliate and fire him.\n\nSenior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, normally a firm supporter of Trump, said in a tweet that he had “total confidence” in Milley as Joint Chiefs chairman.\n\n“I support his statement in both substance and spirit regarding the recent presidential visit to St. Johns.”&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;London, United Kingdom | AFP | Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday said a wave of anti-racism protests across Britain had been “hijacked by extremists”, as fears mounted about clashes between activists and far-right groups.\n\nIn London, authorities boarded up several statues, including one of World War II leader Winston Churchill, after previous damage and with further demonstrations planned.\n\nMayor Sadiq Khan said the monuments, as well as the Cenotaph war memorial, were being protected against the risk of “disorder, vandalism and violence”.\n\nStatues and monuments to figures involved in Britain’s colonial past and the international slave trade have become increasing targets for activists over the last week.\n\nThat has prompted calls for a re-examination of how the country’s historical legacy is marked in public spaces, and for many monuments to be torn down or relocated to museums.\n\nOn Sunday, crowds in Bristol, southwest England, toppled a statue to a 17th century slave trader and philanthropist, Edward Colston, and threw it into the harbour.\n\nBut while recognising the “legitimate desire to protest against discrimination”, Johnson said: “We cannot now try to edit or censor our past.\n\n“We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations,” he wrote on Twitter.\n\n“They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults.\n\n“To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.”\n\nThe protests were sparked by the death during a US police arrest of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American, which have triggered outrage around the world.\n\nJohnson acknowledged the anger of black and minority ethnic communities and said there had been “huge” strides in tackling discrimination in Britain.\n\nBut after clashes marred largely peaceful demonstrations in London, he added: “It is clear that the protests have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence.\n\n“The attacks on the police and indiscriminate acts of violence which we have witnessed over the last week are intolerable and they are abhorrent.”\n\n– Tensions high –\n\nWith tensions running high and police promising a “robust” response to violence, the Black Lives Matter group called off a demonstration planned for Saturday in London’s Hyde Park.\n\nThat followed far-right groups saying they would stage a counter-demonstration.\n\n“We want the protests to be a safe space for people to attend however we don’t think it’ll be possible with people like them present,” BLM London said on Instagram.\n\nOn Friday it unveiled a billboard on the banks of the River Thames to more than 3,000 victims of what it called “state and racist violence”.\n\nTheir names were contained in the letters of “I can’t breathe”, Floyd’s last words before his death, as a white police officer held him down in a chokehold.\n\nMayor Khan backed protesters, saying Floyd’s death “must be a catalyst for systemic, lasting change to tackle the racism and inequalities that black people still face today”.\n\nBut both he and Johnson urged people to stay home this weekend, both because of the risk of spreading the coronavirus and of violence.\n\n“Extreme far-right groups who advocate hatred and division are planning counter-protests, which means that the risk of disorder is high,” the London mayor said.\n\n– ‘Absurd and shameful’ –\n\nChurchill’s statue was vandalised last weekend by campaigners who say his “racist” policies led to the deaths of millions of people during famine in the Indian state of Bengal in 1943.\n\nJohnson, who has written a biography of the wartime leader, said it was “absurd and shameful” his memorial would be targeted, as he fought against fascism and tyranny.\n\n“Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial,” the premier wrote.\n\nActivists linked to the Stop Trump Coalition have compiled a crowd-sourced list of more than 60 statues and monuments across Britain that they say “celebrate slavery and racism”.\n\nThe list includes figures such as the 16th century explorer Francis Drake, and Robert Clive, once described as an “unstable sociopath” who managed the East India Company in British-ruled India.\n\nLondon’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals announced it would remove two statues — including to its benefactor Thomas Guy — because of their links to slavery.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;London, United Kingdom | AFP | US and European stock markets were higher Friday as investors turned buyers again after the previous day’s rout on coronavirus economic fallout fears and the likelihood of a second wave of the pandemic in the United States.\n\nThe magnitude of the earthquake caused by the COVID-19 outbreak was brought home by official data showing the British economy shrank 20.4 percent month-on-month in April.\n\nIf everybody agreed that April was likely to be a disastrous month, the figures were still awful and suggest any recovery will take longer than many hope.\n\nAfter sharp losses overnight on Wall Street’s Thursday reverse, Asia fell sharply but then steadied somewhat before Europe reversed early losses to show gains of 1.0 percent in London, 0.6 percent in Frankfurt and 1.5 percent in Paris.\n\nIn New York, the DJIA opened with a sharp advance of 2.7 percent, still leaving it with some way to go to erase Thursday’s loss of nearly seven percent.\n\n– ‘Buying on the dip’ –\n\n“As if it was not already clear that we are living through extraordinary times, investors are piling back into stock on Friday after a sharp sell-off a day earlier,” said analyst Craig Erlam at trading group OANDA.\n\n“While yesterday’s 6.9-percent plunge in the Dow is not even in the top three worst days this year, it is still a quite remarkable daily drop historically.\n\n“Today’s rebound may not last… but these markets are very strange and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s instead being perceived as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity.”\n\nEurope tumbled Thursday on growing virus concerns, with Frankfurt down 4.5 percent, London losing 4.0 percent and Paris sinking 4.7 percent.\n\nGlobal equities dived as investors worried about a second US virus wave and after the US Federal Reserve warned of a “highly uncertain” economic outlook because of the pandemic.\n\nStocks have blasted higher since hitting a deep trough three months ago, supported by trillions of dollars in government and central bank funding and an easing of lockdown measures.\n\nBut the optimism on trading floors was shattered Wednesday when Fed boss Jerome Powell signalled the world’s top economy would take some time to bounce back from the crisis.\n\nWhile his comments, and the bank’s decision to keep interest rates at near zero for at least two years, was as expected, the dose of reality jolted traders.\n\nThat coincided with figures showing a spike in new infections in key states including Texas, California, Arizona and Florida, which fanned concerns of a new wave as the nation slowly reopens.\n\nAsian markets fell further, but losses were shallower than earlier in the day and much lighter than on Wall Street on Thursday, where all three main indexes were routed.\n\n– Key figures around 1300 GMT –\n\nLondon – FTSE 100: UP 1.5 percent at 6,168.92 points\n\nFrankfurt – DAX 30: UP 1.1 percent at 12,095.52\n\nParis – CAC 40: UP 2.0 percent at 4,909.74\n\nEURO STOXX 50: UP 1.5 percent at 3,192.81\n\nTokyo – Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.8 percent at 22,305.48 (close)\n\nHong Kong – Hang Seng: DOWN 0.7 percent at 24,301.38 (close)\n\nShanghai – Composite: FLAT at 2,919.74 (close)\n\nNew York – Dow: UP 2.7 percent at 25,794.26\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 1.0 percent at $36.71 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 1.3 percent at $39.03\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1303 from $1.1299 at 2100 GMT\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 107.341yen from 106.87 yen\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2591 from $1.2602\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 89.80 pence from 89.66&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Burundi court orders swearing in of president-elect\n\nBujumbura, Burundi | AFP | Burundi’s constitutional court on Friday ruled that the country’s newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be sworn in as soon as possible following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\n“No interim necessary, the president-elect …. must be sworn in as soon as possible,” presidential advisor Willy Nyamitwe wrote on Twitter of the court’s announcement.\n\nNkurunziza’s death on Monday aged 55 came just days after the election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, with the constitution calling for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\n“The constitutional court has made its ruling… there is no point to an interim period, the president-elect must be sworn in as soon as possible,” wrote ruling party information secretary Nancy Ninette Mutoni on Twitter.\n\nIt had meanwhile been feared that the path forward would be determined not by the courts or his ministers, but by an innermost “crisis committee” answering to the president’s office.\n\nThis group is made up of powerful generals who like Nkurunziza, who ruled for 15 often tumultuous years, emerged from the ethnic Hutu rebellion during Burundi’s long civil war which ended in 2006.\n\nNkurunziza had wanted speaker of the national assembly Nyabenda to succeed him, but powerful army generals he runs the country with opted for Ndayishimiye who won the May 20 election. While also a general, Ndayishimiye is not a regime hardliner and Nkurunziza was expected to continue to play a significant role.\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 people dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi in the years after.\n\nRumours swirled on social media about his death, with some suspecting he had been infected by coronavirus.\n\nHis wife, first lady Denise Bucumi, who was reportedly recovering from the coronavirus in a Nairobi hospital, flew back to Bujumbura late Tuesday.&#39;,

                          &#39;text&#39;: &#39;Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Mental health experts say it’s important that health workers are tested for their mental readiness to work in COVID-19 treatment units.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting held by the Makerere University School of Public Health, Entebbe Grade B hospital Director Dr Moses Muwanga says they are working on a periodical assessment of their health workers for alertness as a small error could end up infecting a whole lot of health workers.\n\nHe adds that before the 23 health workers that tested positive for COVID-19 were announced, they had been not allowing health workers with anxiety disorders in the ward.\n\nAccording to Muwanga, there are currently about 128 patients admitted but they allow eight non-patients to access the ward including research teams of epidemiologists, caretakers, psychosocial teams and medical workers.\n\nHe notes currently however that though no health worker at Entebbe has tested positive, many of them are exhausted and some stressed something that could fuel more complicated mental health issues.\n\nProf. Noelene Nakasujja who heads the department of psychiatry at Makerere University says that researchers are currently collecting data and enrolling participants in a study funded by the government to establish how far COVID-19 has affected health workers.\n\nShe said assessing the health workers is vital for halting further spread of the disease. Nakasuija adds that the findings will inform the kind of interventions that will cater to the mental wellness of health workers.\n\nHowever, even as 23 health workers have tested positive, it’s not clear whether they got the virus from the hospital in line of duty or the community.\n\n******\n\nURN&#39;,
