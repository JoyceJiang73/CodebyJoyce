              <h4>Abstract</h4>

              <p class="lead">The existence of fandoms comes from the need of self-identity construction and social capital acquisition. The fandom psychology of pop idol groups can be explained by the engagement, belongingness, companionship, familiarity, and controllability fans perceived in the idolization. This research attempted to identify psychological factors that determine pop idol groups’ likability and popularity. The study conducted content analysis to analyze the audience’s engagement, the familiarity and controllability perceived by fans on social media platforms.</p>

              <hr class="w-100px">
              <p>The pop idol group is a cultural phenomenon and popular business model in the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Kim, 2011). Entertainment companies fully pay for the training and accommodation expenses of pre-idol trainees with the expectation of branding them in groups for their performances to generate revenue (Leung, 2017). Teenagers who wish to become idols drop out of high school and are intensively trained in singing, dancing, acting, English, and other skills that are essential for them to become idols (Leung, 2017). These pre-idol trainees are competing with their peers to receive votes from fans and get the chance to form pop idol groups (Siriyuvasak &amp; Hyunjoon, 2007). The market for pop idol groups is expected to reach over 100 billion RMB (17 billion dollars) in China by 2020. Roughly 20% to 40% of fans have spent money on supporting their favorite pop idol groups&rsquo; debuts and performances (Oh &amp; Park, 2012).</p>
              <p>Fans are members of a target audience who share interests in the same cultural object, which could be a film, a band, or an idol (McCudden, 2011). They engage in fan activities and form fan communities to support their favorite idols and exchange information about their favorite objects (McCudden, 2011). The existence of fandom comes from the need of self-identity construction and social capital acquisition (Leiser, 2018; Seregina &amp; Schouten, 2017). Seregina and Schouten (2017) explained that self-identity construction in fans appears because fans support idols who have similar or admirable personalities, which affects fans&rsquo; conceptualization and realization of their own identities. Fans acquire social capital when they become part of fan communities, which keep them integrated into society and help them gain a sense of belonging (Seregina &amp; Schouten, 2017). The prevalence of the Internet and social media makes it easy for fans to engage in online fan activities, such as watching idols&rsquo; videos and commenting on idols&rsquo; performance, which further enhances their feelings of camaraderie with both idols and fan communities (Hirt &amp; Clarkson, 2011; McCudden, 2011).</p>
              <p>The psychology of fans of pop idol groups can be explained using three factors, which include engagement, familiarity, and controllability that fans perceive through the idolization (Hirt &amp; Clarkson, 2011; Reysen &amp; Branscom, 2010). These three factors determine the likability and the popularity of a pop idol group (Hirt &amp; Clarkson, 2011). Fans experience high levels of engagement during the social capital acquisition process by exchanging and generating information about idols (McCudden, 2011). For pop idol group fans, this information exchange process is actively conducted by reading and writing comments about their idols&rsquo; performance videos and reality shows (Teslenko, 2016). Fans&rsquo; perception of familiarity increases during their self-identity construction process because fans tend to favor idols or idol groups that have personalities similar to their own (Leiser, 2018). In the pop idol group culture, the audience perceives even higher levels of familiarity because most idols have normal teenager lives and did not have any talents before they were intensively trained by entertainment companies (Seregina &amp; Schouten, 2017). Positive controllability comes from the unique business model of pop idol groups (Leiser, 2018). Specifically, fans&rsquo; votes and voices are determinant factors when companies decide which trainees should make debuts and become idols (Oh &amp; Park, 2012).</p>
              <p>Considerable research related to East Asian pop idol groups has focused on the business model and the social media exposure of pop idol groups (Leiser, 2018). However, fandom&mdash;an inalienable element of the culture surrounding pop idol groups&mdash;has been neglected in the literature (McCudden, 2011). This study fills the gap in previous research by considering psychological factors of fandom in East Asian pop idol group culture. A content analysis has been conducted to analyze engagement, familiarity, and controllability perceived by the audience and fans on social media platforms and how these factors affect the likability of pop idol groups.</p>

              <h4>Literature Review</h4>
              <p>Previous literature and empirical research have emphasized the influential elements in fandom psychology. McCudden (2011) conducted in-depth interviews and naturalistic observations of fans from the Comic Con Convention to discuss the change in authentic fandom when fan activities transform from offline events to online media platforms. The researcher utilized content analysis to code and analyze participants&rsquo; interviews and categorized participants from big fans to casual fans (McCudden, 2011). The internet-based fan communities allow fans to participate in fan discussion and collect knowledge about their idols more easily (McCudden, 2011). With the advent of the Internet and social media, fans have begun to experience the disappearance of hierarchy in fandom and the increase in the authenticity of idols (McCudden, 2011).</p>
              <p>The Internet also promotes fans&rsquo; perception in global citizenship (Plante, Roberts, Reysen, &amp; Gerbasi, 2014). Plante, Roberts, Reysen, and Gerbasi (2014) introduced the concept of global citizenship, which is when fans identify themselves as belonging to global communities instead of being restricted by geographical differences. The researchers (2014) founded fans often feel more strongly that they belong to global communities when they interact with other fans and participant in fan activities on social media platforms (Plante, Roberts, Reysen, &amp; Gerbasi, 2014).</p>
              <p>Similarly, Nikunen (2014) agreed with the enhancement in global citizenship identification through fandom participation. This researcher conducted twelves interviews on Finnish websites as well as a participatory observation of Finnish online fan meetings (Nikunen, 2014). This study concluded that fans experienced inclusion that was not bounded by time and space online (Nikunen, 2014). The cross-border online fan communities increase fans&rsquo; perceptions of deterritorialization (Nikunen, 2014). However, in addition to the research of Plante, Roberts, Reysen, and Gerbasi on global citizenship, Nikunen (2014) discussed fans&rsquo; interests in face-to-face meet-ups with other fans. The number of these meetings increases when fans attempt to make a distinction between their social lives online and in reality (Nikunen, 2014).</p>
              <p>Raviv, Bar-Tal, Raviv, and Ben-Horin (1996) discussed adolescent fanship and idolization as a subcategory of fandom. Questionnaires completed by students at elementary and middle schools showed that younger children are more likely to engage in worship and modeling of pop idols (Raviv, Bar-Tal, Raviv &amp; Ben-Horin, 1996). The process of actively collecting information and imitating their idols enhanced their confidence by distinguishing them from their parents (Raviv, Bar-Tal, Raviv &amp; Ben-Horin, 1996).&nbsp; He (2006) also sent out thousands of questionnaires in China to study how children worship pop idols. According to He&rsquo;s (2006) research, 77.3% of children had worshipped public figures in their process of growth. Most children worship pop idols because they consider pop idols more real, vivid, and tangible than the impeccable and flawless type of traditional idols (He, 2006). Pop idols effectively serve as references for children to plan their own lives as they grow up (He, 2006).&nbsp; Both Raviv, Bar-Tal, Raviv, and Ben-Horin (1996) and He (2006) concluded that adolescent idolization significantly decreases with age, especially when teenagers go to high schools.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Different from previous studies, Seregina and Schouten (2017) investigated fans&rsquo; psychology needs when they participate in fan activities. The researchers collected fifteen stories about fans to analyze how idolization in the social media age generates a flat learning culture that allows fans to easily gain information from idols for imitation (Seregina &amp; Schouten, 2017).&nbsp; Some fans seek to accumulate social capital in online fan communities when they lack a sense of belonging in their inherited places (Seregina &amp; Schouten, 2017). Reysen and Branscom (2010) also researched fan psychology among sports fans. They conducted a survey by asking sport fans how they perceived positive attributes, such as collective happiness, shared values, self-identification, and emotional connection in fan participation (Branscom, 2010). Sport fans rated fan communities higher in all four categories when compared with their neighborhoods (Branscom, 2010). Both Seregina and Schouten (2017) and Branscom (2010) concluded that fans perceive positive psychological factors when they participate in fan activities.&nbsp;</p>
              
              
          
              <h4>Method</h4>
              <p><strong>Sample</strong></p>
              <p>The content analysis sample was composed of 172 published comments. The sample included 172 comments from<em> Producer 101</em>, a reality show in China that closely reveals the day-to-day lives of pre-idol trainees on a Chinese social media platform, <em>Tencent Video Channel. </em>The first fifteen comments of each episode were coded. The dates of the reviews spanned from May 2018 to November 2018.</p>
              <p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
              <p>The comments were rated by graduate students. The rater was trained in the operationalization of variables and in the coding procedures. A total of seven variables were coded. The first of these variables, Positivity, was defined as how the audience liked the pop idol group created by <em>Producer 101</em>. The second variable coded was Target and was defined as comments referring to the group or the idol. This variable lists the targets that could be mentioned by the audience. Examples of the targets included the entire group, the specific idol or idols from the group, both the group and specific idols, and neither the group nor specific idols. The third variable coded was Number of Words in one comment. The fourth variable was Number of Likes received by one comment, and the fifth variable was Number of Dislikes received by one comment. The sixth variable coded was Familiarity and was defined as whether the audience mentioned specific experiences or features of idols that were similar to what happens in the real world. The last variable was Controllability, which refers to how the audience members perceived their ability to influence idols&rsquo; destiny from this reality show. The full codebook can be seen in the Appendix.</p>


              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>Frequency analysis revealed that among all comments, specific idols (72.7%) were mentioned the most frequently, followed by mentioning the entire idol group (23.3%) and mentioning neither a group nor an idol (4.1%).</p>
              <p>Frequency analysis revealed that among all comments, the negative comments (38.7%) appeared the most frequently, followed by the positive comments (36.3%) and the neutral comments (25.0%).</p>
              <p>A series of one-sample <em>t</em> tests were conducted to determine which characteristics received higher scores by comparing comments to the midpoint neutral value of 3.0. Comments on <em>Tencent</em> video channel in general received a high score for the positivity of a comment (<em>M</em> = 3.01, <em>SD</em> = 1.24), users&rsquo; perception of the controllability (<em>M</em> = 3.20, <em>SD</em> = 1.34) and users&rsquo; perception of the familiarity (<em>M</em> = 3.80, <em>SD</em> = 1.10). Only the familiarity was positively perceived by users with the mean value significantly different from the midpoint (neutral) value of 3.0: <em>t</em>(159) = 9.22, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>d</em> = .73 indicating the audience perceived positive familiarity when they watch the show about the pop idol group. Both the positivity <em>t</em>(167) = .12, <em>p</em> = .901, <em>d</em> = .01 and the controllability <em>t</em>(157) = 1.84, <em>p</em> = .067, <em>d</em> = .15 indicating the audience neither significantly expressed nor not express the positivity and the controllability when they watch the show.</p>
              <p>A series of independent sample <em>t </em>tests were conducted to test whether commenting on the entire idol group or on specific idols from this group would affect users&rsquo; express of positivity, familiarity and controllability. The results of positivity <em>t</em>(159) = 3.27, <em>p</em> = .001, <em>d</em> = .60 and controllability <em>t</em>(149) = 3.90, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>d</em> = .79 significantly reflected that when users commented on the entire group, they were more likely to write more positively (<em>M</em> = 3.58, <em>SD</em> = 1.04) and feel more controllability (<em>M</em> = 3.97, <em>SD</em> = .98), and when users commented on specific idols, they write less positively (<em>M</em> = 2.84, <em>SD</em> = .1.29) and feel less controllability (<em>M</em> = 2.95, <em>SD</em> = .1.37).</p>
              <p>A series of independent sample <em>t </em>tests were conducted to test whether commenting on the entire idol group or on specific idols from this group would affect the length of a comment and numbers of likes and dislikes received by a comment. The results of length <em>t</em>(163) = -2.19, <em>p</em> = .030, <em>d</em> =.40 and number of likes received <em>t</em>(163) = -2.59, <em>p</em> = .010, <em>d</em> = .47 significantly reflected that when users commented on specific idols, they were more likely to write longer comments (<em>M</em> = 79.64, <em>SD</em> = 68.02) and receive more likes (<em>M</em> = 3720.34, <em>SD</em> = 3220.32), and when users commented on the entire group, they wrote shorter (<em>M</em> = 55.45, <em>SD</em> = 27.84) and received less likes (<em>M</em> = 2313.40, <em>SD</em> = 2083.20). The effect sizes <em>d</em> for both length and the number of likes had classification of <em>d</em> as medium.</p>
              <p>A series of one-sample <em>t</em> tests were conducted to determine which characteristics received higher scores among fans (users with score of positivity higher than neutral value 3.0) by comparing comments to the midpoint neutral value of 3.0. Fans&rsquo; comments on <em>Tencent</em> video channel in general received a high score for controllability (<em>M</em> = 4.23, <em>SD</em> = .76), and familiarity (<em>M</em> = 4.40, <em>SD</em> = .60). Both controllability and familiarity were positively perceived by fans with mean values significantly different from the midpoint (neutral) value of 3.0: controllability <em>t</em>(30) = 8.96, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>d</em> = 1.61, and familiarity <em>t</em>(34) = 13.72, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>d</em> = 2.32 indicating fans expressed strong familiarity and controllability when they watch the show of their idols.</p>
              <p>The number of likes received by a comment was found to have a significant positive correlation with dislikes received by a comment (<em>r </em>= .35, <em>p </em>&lt; .001). Comments received more likes were likely to receive more dislikes from other users.</p>
              <p>A series of two correlations were conducted. A non-significant positive correlation was found between the length of a comment and the number of dislikes received by a comment (<em>r </em>= .03, <em>p </em>= .707). However, there was a tendency for users who were likely to receive more dislikes if they wrote a longer comment. No correlation was found between the length of a comment and the number of likes received by a comment (<em>r </em>= .00, <em>p </em>= .999). The length of a comment did not affect the number of likes received.</p>
              <p>Multiple regression analysis examined if the number of likes (<em>b</em> = -.01, <em>p</em> = .908) and dislikes received (<em>b</em> = -.01, <em>p</em> = .804), the length of a comment (<em>b</em> = -.08, <em>p</em> = .876), familiarity perceived (<em>b</em> = .30, <em>p</em> &lt; .001), and controllability perceived by users (<em>b</em> = .64, <em>p</em> &lt; .001), predicted the positivity of a comment. These variables significantly predicted the positivity of a comment <em>F</em>(5, 140) = 45.60, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = .62. However, only familiarity and controllability perceived by users were significant predictors.</p>

              <h4>Discussion</h4>
              <p>Most audience members are interested in specific idols from pop idol groups, instead of viewing a group of idols as an integral identity. Pop idol groups are differentiated from individual idols by bringing more diversity in personalities within a group (Ishii, Ota, Koguchi, &amp; Koki, 2013). Fans identify with idols with certain personalities they want to associate with from groups. This association better fulfills the need of fans&rsquo; identity constructions (Leiser, 2018).</p>
              <p>At the same time, neutral attitudes have been found the least among all comments, which demonstrates that most audience members express strong feelings about pop idol groups, whether positively or negatively. Fans of pop idol groups show an extremely high level of engagement on social media platforms by writing 50 to 80 characters and receiving thousands of likes on one single comment. The engagement increases even more when fans talk about specific idols from a group instead of mentioning the group as a whole.</p>
              <p>One unique feature determined by the business model of pop idol groups is that fans are likely to support very specific idols within a group and consider other idols&rsquo; teammates as competing with their favorite idols (Ishii, Ota, Koguchi, &amp; Koki, 2013). This model enhances fans&rsquo; interactivity between each other by defaming other team members and defending their favorite idols (Ishii, Ota, Koguchi, &amp; Koki, 2013). The high interactivity level meets fans&rsquo; need of belongingness and acquiring social capital by supporting the same idols in the fan community (Seregina &amp; Schouten, 2017).</p>
              <p>Pop idol groups are extremely popular in East Asian countries where one comment on a social media platform can receive more than 2000 likes. The number of likes can increase to more than 3500 when the comment mentions the entire pop idol group. This phenomenon might be explained by the fact that when an audience member makes a comment about an entire group, fans of specific idols from this group are less likely to object or disagree with this comment (Ishii, Ota, Koguchi, &amp; Koki, 2013). Surprisingly, the length of a comments was not related to the number of likes or dislikes received by a comment. However, the number of likes is positively correlated with the number of dislikes received by a comment. Both higher numbers of likes and dislikes came from comments showing stronger emotions, and they demonstrated higher interactivity with the audience (McCudden, 2011; Siriyuvasak &amp; Hyunjoon, 2007). The fans&rsquo; engagement level increases when they express either positive or negative feelings about idols (McCudden, 2011).</p>
              <p>Both the audience&rsquo;s perception of the familiarity and the controllability of one pop idol group positively contribute to the likability and the popularity of a group. Fans perceive more positive familiarity and controllability than the general audience. These results align with previous research, which has shown that idols are more likable when audience members consider pop idols to be more authentic, easier to imitate, and more able to serve as references for fans to plan their lives (He, 2006).</p>
              <p>Multiple linear regression showed that controllability has a greater influence than familiarity. This difference is also determined by the unique business model of pop idol groups in the East Asian market (Ishii, Ota, Koguchi, &amp; Koki, 2013). Pop idol group culture is different from traditional idols because fans feel they are more empowered by voting to determine which idols will debut and become leaders of teams (Siriyuvasak &amp; Hyunjoon, 2007).</p>
              <p>However, the audience perceives high positive familiarity of pop idol groups, whether the audience expresses positive, neutral, or negative attitudes about idol groups. Additionally, the familiarity perceived is also unaffected, whether the audience is more interested in specific idols or the entire group. The results demonstrated that idols from pop idol groups are naturally very similar to normal teenagers before they leave high school to become pre-idols trainees (Oh &amp; Park, 2012).</p>
              <p>This study highlights the pop idol phenomenon in East Asia and the ways in which fan psychology and the relationship between fans and idol groups have changed with the proliferation of social media platforms. The practical implication is that this study provides pop idol group agencies with a comprehensive understanding of fans, which is helpful to entertainment companies that conduct marketing and branding business with pre-idol trainees.</p>
              <p>One of the limitations of this study is that, since the show <em>Producer 101</em> was launched in summer, more comments might have been written by young adults and teenagers because they have more time to write comments during the summer break, which could result in skewed dataset. Collecting comments from pop idol group&rsquo;s performance that is not seasonal could provide a more accurate dataset. Additionally, comments were only coded on a Chinese social media platform. Future research could collect and code comments from multiple social media platforms in the East Asian market to generate a more comprehensive analysis.</p>
