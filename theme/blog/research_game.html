              <h4>Abstract</h4>

              <p class="lead">There is evidence that players can become addicted to casual mobile games. This study identified seven elements that are frequently adopted in casual mobile game designs and could trigger game addictions. The study used a seven-item game addiction scale (GAS) to access the addiction level of casual mobile gamers. Adverse effects on addicted players, such as being isolated from social contacts, neglecting important activities, and undermining psychological conditions, were identified through the GAS.</p>

              <hr class="w-100px">

              <p>The proliferation of the Internet has resulted in more users spending ever-increasing time on online video games in place of other media and entertainment (Blinka &amp; Mikuska, 2014). Among all game genres, casual games are defined as games with simple rules and short playing sessions that are less time-consuming, and that usually help players learn skills (Wolverton, 2007; Blinka &amp; Mikuska, 2014). This game genre, as one of the most accessible, prevalent, and dominant type of video game genres, targets a broader audience and plays an important role in the mobile game market (Chen &amp; Leung, 2015). Even though casual games apps are known for their simple game mechanisms with less involvement and time commitment for casual gamers as oppose to hardcore gamers (Chesham, Wyss, Muri, Mosimann &amp; Nef, 2017), there is evidence that players can become addicted to casual mobile games (Chen &amp; Leung, 2015).</p>
              <p>Extensive empirical research on problematic video game use and video game addiction has been conducted over the last decade (Griffiths, Kuss &amp; King, 2012). Video game addiction refers to excessive and compulsory game playing that negatively influences players&rsquo; daily life (Weinstein, 2010). Previous research has demonstrated the existence of addicted video game players, especially in male gamers and adolescents (Rooij, Schoenmak, Vermulst, Eijnden &amp; Mheen, 2007). Wong and Hodgins (2013) stated that video game addiction features similar physiological symptoms to gambling and substance addiction. Adverse effects on addicted players include being isolated from social contacts, neglecting important activities, and undermining psychological conditions (Weinstein, 2010; Rooij, Schoenmak, Vermulst, Eijnden &amp; Mheen, 2007).</p>
              <p>Lemmens, Valkenburg and Peter (2009) introduced seven criteria that are associated with video game addictions &mdash; salience, tolerance, mood modification, withdrawal, relapse, conflict and problems &mdash; for measuring the game addiction scale (GAS). Salience refers to video game play dominating players&rsquo; attention and becoming more important in their daily lives (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2009). Tolerance is defined as players gradually building up their time spent on video games (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2009). Mood modification occurs when players perceive feelings of relaxation and use gaming to escape from the real world (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2009). Withdrawal refers to players experiencing unpleasant feelings when game play is suddenly stopped. Relapse occurs when players unsuccessfully attempt to stop playing and quickly restore gaming habits after a period of self-control (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2009). Conflict refers to interpersonal conflicts caused by game play (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2009). Problems refer to players neglecting important activities in their daily lives as the result of game play (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2009).</p>
              <p>With the prevalence of the smartphone as a portable device, the size of the game market has expanded exponentially and mobile game addiction has become an ongoing public health concern (Sun, Zhao, Jia &amp; Zheng, 2015). At the same time, online game addiction is predicted to penetrate from hardcore gamers to more casual game players (Parka &amp; Ahna, 2010). However, few studies related to game addiction have been undertaken for casual mobile games (Wolverton, 2007). This study fills this gap in previous research by providing a better understanding of the addictiveness of mobile casual games by analyzing seven elements from these types of games.</p>
              <p>Wolverton (2007) claimed that mobile game addictions should be investigated differently from online video games because of their distinct features in screen sizes, visual effects, sounds and animations. Seven elements &mdash; colorful designs, juicy feedback, disproportionate rewards, simple rules, short playing sessions, animation effects and social elements &mdash; are examined to understand casual mobile game addiction in this research. Casual game developers frequently adapt auditory rewards to accompany visual rewards when players meet qualified points and difficulty levels (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010). Juicy feedback is defined as the large amount of auditory and visual feedback that effectively contributes to a positive gaming experience (Boxer, 2014). Disproportionate rewards are also a common technique in casual games, where rewards generated are higher than players&rsquo; expectations to portray wins as more satisfying and rewarding (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010; Stuart, 2014). Though casual mobile games are usually designed for single players, social elements are present when players make friends, engage in score ranking and share on social media (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010). The seven elements above are the most frequently mentioned reasons for the success of casual mobile games in previous academic research (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010; Boxer, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Mobile games are also considered more gender-neutral, meaning that more female players are exposed to the risk of game addiction (Griffiths, Kuss &amp; King, 2012). It is necessary to understand how these seven elements of casual mobile games can have different consequences for different demographic groups (Griffiths, Kuss &amp; King, 2012). A survey was conducted to understand these elements in casual mobile games and their effects on different demographic groups in causing casual mobile gamers&rsquo; addictions.</p>
              <p>Hypothesis:</p>
              <p>H1: The seven elements - colorful designs, juicy feedback, disproportionate rewards, simple rules, short playing sessions, animation effects and social elements - are positively correlated to addictions in casual mobile games.</p>
              <p>H2: The seven elements affect male and female players differently in relation to addiction to casual mobile games.</p>

              <h4>Literature Review</h4>
              <p>Previous research has emphasized the measurement of and reasons for video game addiction (Griffiths, Kuss &amp; King, 2012). Lemmens, Valkenburg and Peter (2009) were the first group of researchers to develop and validate a game addiction scale (GAS) for adolescents. They perceived that teenagers are more likely to be negatively affected by game addiction than adults (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2012). The researchers identified seven diagnostic factors that account for game addiction based on pathological gambling criteria, being silence, tolerance, mood modification, withdrawal, relapse, conflict and problems (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2012). All seven factors were found to be positively correlated with their higher order factor &mdash; GAS (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2012). GAS has been proved for its population cross-validity, that is, the result in one sample group is applicable to another independent sample group (Lemmens, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2012). Lemmens, Valkenburg and Peter (2009) also demonstrated GAS&rsquo;s concurrent validity, meaning the selected seven factors and GAS score are correlated to other empirical video gaming behaviors, such as time consumption, aggression, decrease in social competence and reduced life satisfaction caused by excessive use of video games.</p>
              <p>GAS represents a concrete and reliable measurement scale for video game addiction, while Lemmens, Valkenburg and Peter (2009) suggested further research could be undertaken for different age groups. Similarly, Wong and Hodgins (2013) created a game addiction inventory for adults (GAIA) based on the criteria of gambling and substance addiction. The criteria are specifically differentiated for adult gamers as opposed to adolescents, and include loss of control, agitated withdrawal, mournful withdrawal and shame (Wong &amp; Hodgins, 2013). The GAIA scale is significantly correlated with the GAS score for adult players, which supports the validity of GAS for players beyond adolescents (Wong &amp; Hodgins, 2013).</p>
              <p>Khazaal and other researchers (2018) utilized an item response theory (IRT) model to verify the effectiveness of GAS in a cross-border study by sending a survey to young adult men in both France and Germany. This research confirmed that GAS is a reliable measurement for gamers in general whose GAS scores are located within 0.35-2.5 standard deviations of the mean (Khazaal et al., 2018). Among all seven factors, relapse, withdrawal and problems are more important variables for analyzing players&rsquo; video game addictions, while silence and mood modification are perceived to have lower discriminatory power in determining video game addiction (Khazaal et al., 2018).</p>
              <p>Unlike other empirical research, Ko, Yen, Chen, Chen and Yen (2005) examined gender differences in video game addiction among Taiwanese adolescents. The researchers adopted a Chinese Internet addiction scale (CIAS) and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES) to measure game addiction and perception of self-esteem separately (Ko et al., 2005). A negative relation was found between adolescents&rsquo; game addiction and self-esteem level (Ko et al., 2005). Based on this empirical research, male teenagers reported more addicted behaviors than female teenagers (Ko et al., 2005). The reason is that girls, receiving more adult supervision, spend more time studying and have less exposure to game addiction risks than boys in East Asian cultures (Ko et al., 2005).</p>
              <p>Building upon previous literature on video game addiction, Chen and Leung (2015) discussed psychological factors in mobile social game addiction. Mobile games are generally easier to play, require less time commitment, and are more casual than PC and console games. These differences lead to distinct factors that contribute to mobile social game addiction, which are loneliness, leisure boredom and lack of self-control (Chen &amp; Leung, 2015). Leisure boredom was positively correlated with mobile addiction (Chen &amp; Leung, 2015). The explanation is that when players experience boredom, they desire psychological rewards from casual mobile games because they expect just the right amount of time for each playing session in these games (Chen &amp; Leung, 2015).</p>
              
              <h4>Method</h4>
              <p><strong>Participants</strong></p>
              <p>A study with the description &ldquo;Survey about Casual Mobile Games&rdquo; was used to recruit 184 participants (102 males and 82 females) from Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanical Turk, each of whom was paid 20 cents. Participation was limited to participants located in the United States with a past approval rating in the Mechanical Turk system above 70%. The majority of participants (53.8%) were aged between 25-34. Most participants played casual games on their mobiles every day (53.6%) or two to three times a week (28.2%).</p>
              <p><strong>Materials and Procedure</strong></p>
              <p>An online survey was used to collect data from April 22, 2019 to April 23, 2019. The survey contained 17 questions (see Appendix) and was divided into 3 sections: casual mobile game player behavior, elements in casual mobile games, and the game addiction scale (GAS). The first section, casual mobile game player behavior, addressed the players&rsquo; habits and experiences in casual mobile games. An example question from this section was, &ldquo;How often do you play casual games on your mobile&rdquo;. The next section examined seven elements in casual mobile games. An example question from this section was, &ldquo;Recalling all kinds of casual mobile games that you have played, please indicate your level of agreement with the following statements: I often find colorful designs in casual mobile games I played&rdquo;. The other section measured GAS in casual mobile games. The seven-item questions of GAS were modified for investigating game addiction in casual mobile games. An example question from this section was, &ldquo;Recalling all kinds of casual mobile games that you have played, please indicate your level of agreement with the following statements: Others have unsuccessfully tried to reduce my casual mobile game use&rdquo;. The majority of questions were answered via a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from &ldquo;strongly disagree&rdquo; to &ldquo;strongly agree.&rdquo; The remaining questions used multiple choice or text entry.</p>              

              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>Frequency analysis revealed that among all results, most of the participants play casual mobile games every day (53.6%), followed by two to three times a week (28.2%) and once a week (16.0%).</p>
              <p>Frequency analysis revealed that among all comments, most of the participants (84.7%) are addicted to causal mobile games based on the game addiction scale (GAS).</p>
              <p>A series of one-sample <em>t</em> tests were conducted to determine the possibility of participants conducting certain behaviors in causal mobile games by comparing responses to the midpoint neutral value of 4.0. Participants, in general, enjoy playing casual mobile games (<em>M</em> = 5.57, <em>SD</em> = 1.20), spend money (<em>M</em> = 5.17, <em>SD</em> = 1.61), feel more connected with friends (<em>M</em> = 4.94, <em>SD</em> = 1.75), and have made friends (<em>M</em> = 5.18, <em>SD</em> = 1.62) in casual mobile games. All four behaviors were positively perceived by players with mean values significantly different from the midpoint (neutral) value of 4.0: enjoyment <em>t</em>(183) = 17.70, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, connection with friends <em>t</em>(183) = 9.89, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, monetary consumption <em>t</em>(182) = 7.29, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, and making new friends <em>t</em>(183) = 9.90, <em>p</em> &lt; .001.</p>
              <p>A series of two correlations were conducted between GAS and players&rsquo; enjoyment and tendency of spending money in casual mobile games. Significant positive correlations were found for both enjoyment level (<em>r </em>= .30, <em>p </em>&lt; .001) and tendency of spending money (<em>r </em>= .75, <em>p </em>&lt; .001). Players who are more addicted to casual mobile games enjoy games more and are more likely to spend money in casual mobile game apps.</p>
              <p>A series of independent sample <em>t </em>tests were conducted to test whether non-addicted players or addicted players engage more with colorful designs, juicy feedback, disproportionate rewards, simple rules, short playing sessions, animation effects and social elements in casual mobile games. The results of simple rules were not significantly different for non-addicted or addicted players. All other six elements in casual mobile games, except simple rules, significantly reflected that addicted players engage with these elements more than non-addicted players in causal mobile games.</p>

              <p>Multiple regression analysis examined if the colorful design (<em>b</em> = .14, <em>p</em> = .212), the juicy feedback (<em>b</em> = .31, <em>p</em> =.002), disproportionate rewards (<em>b</em> = .72, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), simple rules (<em>b</em> = -.16, <em>p</em> = .085), short playing sessions ((<em>b</em> = .03, <em>p</em> = .768), animation effects (<em>b</em> = -.08, <em>p</em> = .498), and social elements (<em>b</em> = .16, <em>p</em> = .108) predicted GAS of each participant. These variables significantly predicted GAS of each participant<em> F</em>(7, 174) = 24.59, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = .50. However, only the juicy feedback and disproportionate rewards were significant predictors.</p>
              <p>A series of seven correlations between GAS and seven elements (colorful designs, juicy feedback, disproportionate rewards, simple rules, short playing sessions, animation effects and social elements) in causal mobile games were conducted for both male and female participants. A non-significant correlation was found between simple rules and GAS for male participants only. All other correlations have significant positive results, which explained that any seven elements in causal mobile games, except simple rules for males, are positively correlated to GAS for players of both genders.</p>

              <h4>Discussion</h4>
              <p>Almost half of the participants reported that they play casual games on their mobiles every day and nearly 85% of participants received above the midpoint of the GAS score. The two results indicate that the majority of players are at a high chance of being addicted to casual mobile games. However, there is a large discrepancy between these results and previous research that only a minority of players are at danger of becoming addicted to gaming and addicted players constitute only 3% among all game genres (Rooij, Schoenmak, Vermulst, Eijnden &amp; Mheen, 2007). Because mobile games and casual games are targeted at a broader audience, players who previously have no interest in hardcore gaming might be addicted and negatively affected by casual mobile games because of the high portability, accessibility, and easiness of this type of game genre (Wong &amp; Hodgins, 2013).</p>
              <p>GAS has a significant positive correlation with players&rsquo; engagement level and social elements they perceived in casual mobile games. The results aligned with Sun, Zhao, Jia, and Zheng&rsquo;s (2015) research that players have different reasons for playing on mobiles as compared with hardcore games because the smartphone is a portable device with limited screen size. Two features of mobile games, hedonic and sociality, contributed to mobile game addictions. Hedonic refers to the pleasure and enjoyment players perceive, and sociality is the social functions players experience in their mobile game play (Sun, Zhao, Jia &amp; Zheng, 2015).</p>
              <p>The high positive correlation between GAS and tendency for spending money on casual mobile games also reemphasized the negative consequence of game addiction (Soroush, Hancock &amp; Bohns, 2014). Players experience lower self-control when they have excessive use of game play (Soroush, Hancock &amp; Bohns, 2014). The frustration and ego-depletion resulting from lower self-control are also correlated with money spent (Soroush, Hancock &amp; Bohns, 2014).</p>
              <p>Only juicy feedback and disproportionate rewards in seven elements were significant predictors in multiple regression of GAS. Juicy feedback is usually instantly delivered by points, audio and visual rewards in casual mobile games (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010). The sound could effectively contribute to excitement and stress during casual game play, which stimulates gamers to play more sessions and consistently seek for more auditory and visual rewards (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010). The disproportionate rewards are common tricks used by a casual game designer where players often have progress bars that seem achievable in a short time, which leads players to a never-ending cycle of getting to the next round of a game (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010). Usually, players could receive some kinds of rewards even when they fail certain tasks (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010).</p>
              <p>In addition to juicy feedback and disproportionate rewards, the engagement in short playing sessions and social elements in casual mobile games significantly differentiates addicted players from non-addicted players. Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang and Collins (2010) introduced the concept of reinforcement schedule in casual games, in which the immediacy of rewards from regular and frequent wins, and short playing sessions generate positive reinforcement for gamers&rsquo; playing experience. Although casual mobile games are generally for single players, players develop a positive perception in social elements by sharing scores and ranks with others verbally or on leader boards (Harrigan, Dixon, Fugelsang &amp; Collins, 2010).</p>
              <p>Ko, Yen, Chen, Chen and Yen (2005) stated that male players show more addicted behaviors than female players because females receive more supervision from parents during their youth. However, females, in general, generate a higher significant positive correlation between each of the seven elements in casual mobile games with mobile game addiction. Among all seven elements, simple rules, short playing sessions and social elements show distinctive high correlation with GAS for females. Different from male players, female players are less engaged in competition and less motivated by the challenge of game play, but more interested in entertaining, relaxing and the social aspects of a game (Wolverton, 2007).</p>
              <p>This study highlights the seven elements that are frequently adopted in casual mobile game designs and how they are correlated with casual mobile game addiction among players. The practical implication is that realizing the triggers of addictiveness could prevent players from unhealthy casual game and mobile game addictions. In addition, game developers could also design more successful games by understanding the factors behind the addictiveness of casual mobile games.</p>
              <p>Though the GAS measurement has been proved for its validity among both adult and international players in previous research, the scale has never been adopted in casual mobile games versions for measuring players&rsquo; game addiction level. The validity of GAS in the casual mobile version might not be high enough. The data collected are self-reported results, which means participants may not have incentives to admit their game addiction and problematic uses of casual mobile games in the survey. In addition, the participants were recruited from Amazon MTruk, who are generally more advanced in technology and have a higher chance of spending more time on Internet use, which could skew the results of game addiction level.</p>
